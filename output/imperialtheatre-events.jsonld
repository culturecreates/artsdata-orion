Awarded as Artist of the Year\r\nby both Ontario Contact (2017) and the BC Touring Council (2015), and mentioned by The Guardian\r\n(Charlottetown) as the Best Classical Performance of 2014, her interpretations have been described\r\nas \"outstandingly inventive\" [University of Waterloo Gazette], âplayed flawlesslyâ [ReviewVancouver].\r\n\r\nA visionary and an idealist, Sarah's performances are conceptually innovative, involving photogra-\r\nphy, dance, and theatre. She is Artistic Director for Pro'ject Sound, a performance project involving\r\n\r\nlive piano with large-scale projected images.\r\nAn avid collaborator, Sarah has performed with cellist Ariel Barnes, violist NicolÃ² Eugelmi, cellist\r\nPhillip Hansen, violinist Robert Uchida, tenor Benjamin Butterfield, horn player Oto Carrillo, soprano\r\nBarbara Livingston, Trio Accord, Ballet Victoria, the Emily Carr String Quartet, the Bergmann Piano\r\nDuo, jazz pianist SÃ¸ren Bebe, clarinettist Keith MacLeod, among many others. Sarah has appeared\r\nas soloist with the Victoria Symphony under the baton of Mei-Ann Chen, the Kitchener-Waterloo\r\nSymphony conducted by Mark Skazinetsky, the West Coast Symphony Orchestra with conductor\r\nBujar Llapaj, and the Symphony Orchestra of the Pacific with conductor Arthur Arnold.\r\nAs a First Prize Winner in the 2013 Bradshaw &amp; Buono International Piano Competition, Sarah was\r\n\r\nawarded the opportunity to perform solo at New York Cityâs Carnegie Hall in May 2013. Sarah re-\r\nleased an album of Goldberg Variations in 2021. Her third album, Women of Note, highlights two for-\r\ngotten female composers of the 18th century, and garnered the 2021 Music PEI Instrumental\r\n\r\nRecording of the Year as well as two ECMA nominations. Sarahâs debut solo album, Glass House\r\nDancing, was nominated for Classical Recording of the Year at the 2009 Western Canadian Music\r\nAwards. Her second album, Devoted: Music of Robert &amp; Clara Schumann, features solo piano works\r\nand Clara Schumannâs Romances, Opus 22 with violinist Martin Chalifour, concertmaster of the Los\r\nAngeles Philharmonic.\r\nSarah has been been heard nationally on CBC Radio 2âs In Concert in a live recording with violinist\r\nJoan Blackman and cellist Ariel Barnes. She was also featured in a live recording and discussion of\r\n\r\nSchumannâs Papillons on CBC Radio Oneâs North by Northwest with host Sheryl MacKay. In Hels-\r\ningborg, Sweden in 2006 she recorded with Swedish cellist Marit SjÃ¶din, creating Concealed Dia-\r\nmonds, an album of masterworks for cello and piano.\r\n\r\nSarahâs primary teachers and mentors have been Jamie Parker, Gregory Chaverdian, Christine\r\nPurvis and Glen Montgomery. She has completed five residencies at the Banff Centre for the Arts\r\nand enjoyed two terms there as collaborative pianist.\r\nDuring her years on the west coast of Canada, Sarah founded nine concert series, curating each\r\none individually, and inviting artists from across Canada and around the world to share the stage\r\nwith her. She has toured throughout Sweden numerous times with cellist Marit SjÃ¶din, violinist Ian\r\n\r\nPeaston, and Per Johansson, principal clarinet of the Helsingborg Symphony Orchestra. Other in-\r\nternational concerts of note include a recital at DePaul University with Oto Carrillo, hornist in the\r\n\r\nChicago Symphony, Schumann Piano Quintet in Darmstadt with members of the Frankfurt Radio\r\nSymphony, and a performance at Carnegie Hall with Polish flautist Krzysztof Kaczka.\r\nIn addition to writing wine reviews for her blog, âARTIST WINES! - Uncorking musician-priced cellar\r\nsecrets,â Sarah tours a one-woman musical comedy show called âPerk up, pianist!â of which the\r\nEdmonton Journal wrote, âHer comic timing is as solid as her musical meter.â"

The NBYO has been shaping the lives of young musicians for six decades and instilling cultural pride across New Brunswick. Playing Mahler represents a unique challenge ofÂ complexity, energy, and skill. But it is not only a singular accomplishment for individual musicians, it is also a source of pride for our entire province.\r\n\r\nTheÂ TITAN ProjectÂ represents a historic accomplishment, as performing Mahlerâs Symphony No. 1 is an ambitious undertaking that very few youth orchestras in the world would attempt, let alone bring to audiences across an entire region.\r\n\r\nSee you at the show!\r\n\r\nProgram:\r\n\r\n \tDance of the KnightsÂ from \"Romeo and Juliet\" by S.

The NBYO has been shaping the lives of young musicians for six decades and instilling cultural pride across New Brunswick. Playing Mahler represents a unique challenge ofÂ complexity, energy, and skill. But it is not only a singular accomplishment for individual musicians, it is also a source of pride for our entire province.\nTheÂ TITAN ProjectÂ represents a historic accomplishment, as performing Mahlerâs Symphony No. 1 is an ambitious undertaking that very few youth orchestras in the world would attempt, let alone bring to audiences across an entire region.\nSee you at the show!\nProgram:\n\nDance of the KnightsÂ from âRomeo and Julietâ by S. Prokofiev.\nLa PremiÃ¨reÂ Rhapsodie pourÂ clarinetteÂ by C. Debussy. Soloist: Kalvin Rowe\nGlosa Sinfonica âMargaritenaâ by I.Â CarreÃ±o\nSymphony No. 1 âTitanâ by G. Mahler.\n\nÂ Movement IÂ â Langsam, schleppend.

LâOJNB faÃ§onne la vie des jeunes musiciens depuis six dÃ©cennies et insuffle une fiertÃ© culturelle dans tout le Nouveau-Brunswick. Jouer Mahler reprÃ©sente un dÃ©fi unique en termes deÂ complexitÃ©, dâÃ©nergie et dâhabiletÃ©. Mais ce nâest pas seulement un accomplissement singulier pour les musiciens individuels, câest aussi une source de fiertÃ© pour toute la province .\nLe projet TITANÂ reprÃ©sente une rÃ©alisation historique, car lâinterprÃ©tation de la Symphonie no 1 de Mahler est une entreprise ambitieuse que trÃ¨s peu dâorchestres de jeunes dans le monde tenteraient, et encore moins de prÃ©senter au public de toute une rÃ©gion.\nProgram:\n\nDance of the KnightsÂ from âRomeo and Julietâ by S.

        "@value": "Canadian comedy veteran Steve Patterson is...\r\n\r\nPatterDad!\r\n\r\nMany Canadians recognize the name Steve Patterson. Heâs been a crowd favorite since his first Just for Laughs Gala appearance back in 2004 and as host of the long-running hit show\r\nThe Debaters on CBC since 2007. But what they may not know is how Pattersonâs perceptions have shifted since he became a dad to two precocious daughters. Those new perceptions are on grand display in his new show which picks up on the themes introduced in his popular book published by Penguin Random House Canada in 2021 âDad Up!â From being outsmarted to being outrun to being outnumbered (current household rankings have him clinging to 6th place in importance behind his wife, his daughters, their dog, and whichever stuffed animal is most essential in any given week), Steve struggles to come to terms with the responsibilities of being a dad. But fortunately for audiences, his struggles are pure comedic delight. Come join this iconic Canadian comedian on a 90-minute fun ride that will warm your heart, rekindle memories, and maybe most importantly, will get you out of the house and laughing with strangers. Which, really, is the best gift families can give to each other.\r\n\r\nSteve Patterson is an award-winning stand-up comedian with over 25 years of international performance experience. As host of the long-running hit radio show and podcast The Debaters and theatre show The Debaters Live, Pattersonâs brand of comedy is best described as honest and erudite combining well-crafted writing with unparalleled off-the-cuff wit. Twice named Canadaâs Best Male Stand-Up at the Canadian Comedy Awards, Patterson is known for masterfully keeping the audience engaged with heartfelt stories, concisely constructed letters, and\r\noriginal songs. In short, Patterson packs much more than punchlines into his show.\r\n\r\nA household name in Canadian comedy through his long-time radio hosting and numerous televised gala appearances, Steve served as anchor for the âIf It Makes You Happyâ Gala at\r\nthe Winnipeg Comedy Festival in 2022 which debuted on CBC and across various media platforms in 2023. He has also taken his award-winning humour to the literary world with The\r\nBook of Letters I Didnât Know Where to Send and his newest release Dad Up! are available wherever books and audiobooks are sold."

Heâs been a crowd favorite since his first Just for Laughs Gala appearance back in 2004 and as host of the long-running hit show\nThe Debaters on CBC since 2007. But what they may not know is how Pattersonâs perceptions have shifted since he became a dad to two precocious daughters. Those new perceptions are on grand display in his new show which picks up on the themes introduced in his popular book published by Penguin Random House Canada in 2021 âDad Up!â From being outsmarted to being outrun to being outnumbered (current household rankings have him clinging to 6th place in importance behind his wife, his daughters, their dog, and whichever stuffed animal is most essential in any given week), Steve struggles to come to terms with the responsibilities of being a dad. But fortunately for audiences, his struggles are pure comedic delight. Come join this iconic Canadian comedian on a 90-minute fun ride that will warm your heart, rekindle memories, and maybe most importantly, will get you out of the house and laughing with strangers. Which, really, is the best gift families can give to each other.\nSteve Patterson is an award-winning stand-up comedian with over 25 years of international performance experience. As host of the long-running hit radio show and podcast The Debaters and theatre show The Debaters Live, Pattersonâs brand of comedy is best described as honest and erudite combining well-crafted writing with unparalleled off-the-cuff wit. Twice named Canadaâs Best Male Stand-Up at the Canadian Comedy Awards, Patterson is known for masterfully keeping the audience engaged with heartfelt stories, concisely constructed letters, and\noriginal songs. In short, Patterson packs much more than punchlines into his show.\nA household name in Canadian comedy through his long-time radio hosting and numerous televised gala appearances, Steve served as anchor for the âIf It Makes You Happyâ Gala at\nthe Winnipeg Comedy Festival in 2022 which debuted on CBC and across various media platforms in 2023. He has also taken his award-winning humour to the literary world with The\nBook of Letters I Didnât Know Where to Send and his newest release Dad Up! are available wherever books and audiobooks are sold.\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t"

        "@value": "DUANE ANDREWSâ music is the product of a great ear, an adventurous spirit and a love of music that is beyond category. Uniting what would seem to be impossible â traditional Newfoundland music with the swing jazz of the legendary Django Reinhardt, Andrews makes it not just work â he makes it soar. The Juno award winning producer, composer, guitarist and globetrotting performerâs latest album is the best evidence yet of his truly unique musical vision and is the sound of him, literally, bringing it all back home.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA native of the island of Newfoundland, off the east coast of Canada, Duane grew up exposed to the islandâs mÃ©lange of cultural influences and his development as a guitarist reflects that. After graduating from the Jazz Studies program at St. FXU with honours, Duane spent several years studying contemporary music composition at the Conservatoire International de Paris and at the Conservatoire National de Region in Marseille, France.\r\n\r\nHis discography starts with the release of his debut solo CD, simply titled, Duane Andrews (2004), which led to the multiple award winning Crocus (2006), then Raindrops (2008), which features a collaboration with the Atlantic String Quartet and two albums with Cape Breton master fiddler Dwayne CÃ´tÃ©, Dwayne CÃ´tÃ© and Duane Andrews (2010) and The Empress (2012).\r\n\r\nOther notable collaborations include Charlieâs Boogie (2013) with bluegrass guitarist/singer/songwriter extraordinaire Craig Young which evolved into Fretboard Journey (2016) with the addition of fellow Newfoundland guitarists Sandy Morris and Gordon Quinton.

Uniting what would seem to be impossible â traditional Newfoundland music with the swing jazz of the legendary Django Reinhardt, Andrews makes it not just work â he makes it soar. The Juno award winning producer, composer, guitarist and globetrotting performerâs latest album is the best evidence yet of his truly unique musical vision and is the sound of him, literally, bringing it all back home.\n\n\nA native of the island of Newfoundland, off the east coast of Canada, Duane grew up exposed to the islandâs mÃ©lange of cultural influences and his development as a guitarist reflects that. After graduating from the Jazz Studies program at St. FXU with honours, Duane spent several years studying contemporary music composition at the Conservatoire International de Paris and at the Conservatoire National de Region in Marseille, France.\nHis discography starts with the release of his debut solo CD, simply titled, Duane Andrews (2004), which led to the multiple award winning Crocus (2006), then Raindrops (2008), which features a collaboration with the Atlantic String Quartet and two albums with Cape Breton master fiddler Dwayne CÃ´tÃ©, Dwayne CÃ´tÃ© and Duane Andrews (2010) and The Empress (2012).\nOther notable collaborations include Charlieâs Boogie (2013) with bluegrass guitarist/singer/songwriter extraordinaire Craig Young which evolved into Fretboard Journey (2016) with the addition of fellow Newfoundland guitarists Sandy Morris and Gordon Quinton. Playing regular Sunday sessions in Quidi Vidi, NL with accordionist Aaron Collis resulted in The Mallard Cottage Sessions (2015) and his most recent collaboration, the Juno award winning More Sheep, Less Sleep (2015) from The Swinging Belles with childrenâs educators Erin Power and Laura Winter, can be found atÂ www.theswingingbelles.ca.\nÂ \nPRESS\nâthe music might be best described as Folk music played by a top Jazz guitarist and the result is refreshing and stunning.

This is a man who embodies pluck and wit, lighthearted yet encumbered, and a naivete that somehow remains endearing.Â  As Derek says: Â In the grand contest of life, he stands proudly as a bona fide \"participant.\"\r\n\r\nWell ... truth be told, thereâs a lot more to it than that.Â  From Vegas to St. John's, this Just For Laughs veteran is universally considered to be among the comic elite. Certainly his peers think so, as evidenced by the fact that he's a four-time nominee, and winner of Best Standup Comic - Canadian Comedy Awards, as well as a multiple Gemini nominee for Best Performance in a Comedy. As Rick Mercer says, \"Everyone knows Derek is the funniest man in Canada.\"\r\n\r\nClearly the critics agree: \"5 STARS - the funniest man on earth\" - Winnipeg Free Press; \"4 STARS - the crowd howled\" - Victoria Times Colonist; \"still the funniest man in Canada\" - Toronto Sun; \"Edwards reigns as the King of Canadian comedy\" - Charlottetown Guardian; \"Derek Edwards is hysterical\" - Calgary Sun; \"Edwards takes stand-up to next stage\" - Georgia Straight; \"the epitome of timing &amp; storytelling\" - Halifax Chronicle Herald; \"the comedian's comedian\" - London Free Press.\r\n\r\nSo come on out and join Derek for his latest show, Oxy Moron, as it makes its way across Canada. Expect a night of perceptive guesswork and charmingly misguided jabs from a cherished performer. Enjoy some hearty laughs, a sprinkling of wisdom, and the pleasure of mingling with fellow humans. It's a triple win!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor more info &amp; comedy clips, visitÂ www.shantero.com"

This is a man who embodies pluck and wit, lighthearted yet encumbered, and a naivete that somehow remains endearing.Â  As Derek says: Â In the grand contest of life, he stands proudly as a bona fide âparticipant.â\nWell â¦ truth be told, thereâs a lot more to it than that.Â  From Vegas to St. Johnâs, this Just For Laughs veteran is universally considered to be among the comic elite. Certainly his peers think so, as evidenced by the fact that heâs a four-time nominee, and winner of Best Standup Comic â Canadian Comedy Awards, as well as a multiple Gemini nominee for Best Performance in a Comedy. As Rick Mercer says, âEveryone knows Derek is the funniest man in Canada.â\nClearly the critics agree: â5 STARS â the funniest man on earthâ â Winnipeg Free Press; â4 STARS â the crowd howledâ â Victoria Times Colonist; âstill the funniest man in Canadaâ â Toronto Sun; âEdwards reigns as the King of Canadian comedyâ â Charlottetown Guardian; âDerek Edwards is hystericalâ â Calgary Sun; âEdwards takes stand-up to next stageâ â Georgia Straight; âthe epitome of timing & storytellingâ â Halifax Chronicle Herald; âthe comedianâs comedianâ â London Free Press.\nSo come on out and join Derek for his latest show, Oxy Moron, as it makes its way across Canada. Expect a night of perceptive guesswork and charmingly misguided jabs from a cherished performer. Enjoy some hearty laughs, a sprinkling of wisdom, and the pleasure of mingling with fellow humans. Itâs a triple win!\n\nFor more info & comedy clips, visitÂ www.shantero.com\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tPerformer's Website Page\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tDerek Edwards: OXY MORON - Official Website\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t"

        "@value": "THE PEKING ACROBATSÂ®\r\n\r\nFor the last thirty two years, THE PEKING ACROBATSÂ® have redefined audience perceptions of Chinese acrobatics. They perform daring maneuvers atop a precarious pagoda of chairs and display their technical prowess at such arts as trick-cycling, precision tumbling, juggling, somersaulting, and gymnastics. They push the limits of human ability, defying gravity with\r\namazing displays of contortion, flexibility, and control. THE PEKING ACROBATS are often accompanied by live musicians who skillfully play traditional Chinese instruments; the time-\r\nhonored Chinese music coalesces with high-tech special effects and awe-inspiring acrobatic feats, creating an exuberant entertainment event with the festive pageantry of a Chinese Carnival.\r\n\r\nSince their founding in 1986, THE PEKING ACROBATS have been featured on numerous television shows and celebrity-studded TV specials. These include Nickelodeonâs Unfabulous, Ellenâs Really Big Show (hosted by Ellen DeGeneres), The Wayne Brady Show, Thatâs Incredible, ABC's Wide World of Sports, and NBC's Ring In The New Year Holiday Special. They have also appeared on HDNet TV's In Focusseries, and have appeared regularly in 3D on NBC/Comcast's new 3D Channel. THE PEKING ACROBATS set the world record for the Human Chair Stack on FOX Network's Guinness Book Primetime television show in 1999: they balanced six people precariously atop six chairs twenty one feet up in the air without safety lines, astounding audiences with their bravery and dexterity. THE PEKING ACROBATS have also made their way onto the silver screen â company members were featured in Steven Soderbergh's hit film Ocean's Eleven playing alongside Julia Roberts, Brad Pitt and George Clooney. PEKING ACROBATS' alumnus Shaobo Qin also appeared in that film's two\r\nsequels, Ocean's Twelve and Ocean's Thirteen.\r\n\r\nTHE PEKING ACROBATS achieved another milestone in the fall of 2003, when they made their orchestral debut at the Hollywood Bowl in Los Angeles, CA. They performed as part of the\r\nHollywood Bowlâs Fireworks Season Finale, where the company blended their unique brand of acrobatics with the majestic sound of the 100-piece Hollywood Bowl Orchestra, conducted by John Mauceri. Since their Hollywood Bowl debut, THE PEKING ACROBATS have performed with many of the most prestigious Symphony Orchestras in North America today. These include the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra; the Ravinia Festival Orchestra, featuring members of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra; the San Diego Symphony Orchestra; the Cincinnati Pops Orchestra; the Buffalo Philharmonic Orchestra; and the San Francisco Symphony Orchestra. THE PEKING ACROBATS return often to the Hollywood Bowl, where they perform with the Hollywood Bowl Orchestra as Special Guest Artists.\r\n\r\nOver their thirty-one year career, THE PEKING ACROBATS have achieved international acclaim, dazzling audiences around the world. In February of 2005, THE PEKING ACROBATS premiered in Italy on a five-week, twelve-city tour. Their opening in Milan became a spectacular media event that was covered nationally by the Italian press. In city after city, THE\r\nPEKING ACROBATS took stage before sold-out crowds, and the reviews were filled with accolades attesting to their superb performances. Since their Italian debut, THE PEKING\r\nACROBATS have performed in seven European countries on their six European Tours between 2005 and today.\r\n\r\nTHE PEKING ACROBATS are part of a time-honored Chinese tradition, rooted in centuries of Chinese history and folk art. Tradition demands that each generation of acrobats add its own improvements and embellishments; because of this, high honor is conferred upon those skilled enough to become acrobats. THE PEKING ACROBATS seek to uphold this rich and ancient folk art tradition, bringing it to new technical heights while integrating twenty-first century technology. In the words of Clive Davis of the New York Post, \"THE PEKING ACROBATS [are] pushing the envelope of human possibility,â combining agility and grace in remarkable feats of âpure artistry.â"

They perform daring maneuvers atop a precarious pagoda of chairs and display their technical prowess at such arts as trick-cycling, precision tumbling, juggling, somersaulting, and gymnastics. They push the limits of human ability, defying gravity with\namazing displays of contortion, flexibility, and control. THE PEKING ACROBATS are often accompanied by live musicians who skillfully play traditional Chinese instruments; the time-\nhonored Chinese music coalesces with high-tech special effects and awe-inspiring acrobatic feats, creating an exuberant entertainment event with the festive pageantry of a Chinese Carnival.\nSince their founding in 1986, THE PEKING ACROBATS have been featured on numerous television shows and celebrity-studded TV specials. These include Nickelodeonâs Unfabulous, Ellenâs Really Big Show (hosted by Ellen DeGeneres), The Wayne Brady Show, Thatâs Incredible, ABCâs Wide World of Sports, and NBCâs Ring In The New Year Holiday Special. They have also appeared on HDNet TVâs In Focusseries, and have appeared regularly in 3D on NBC/Comcastâs new 3D Channel. THE PEKING ACROBATS set the world record for the Human Chair Stack on FOX Networkâs Guinness Book Primetime television show in 1999: they balanced six people precariously atop six chairs twenty one feet up in the air without safety lines, astounding audiences with their bravery and dexterity. THE PEKING ACROBATS have also made their way onto the silver screen â company members were featured in Steven Soderberghâs hit film Oceanâs Eleven playing alongside Julia Roberts, Brad Pitt and George Clooney. PEKING ACROBATSâ alumnus Shaobo Qin also appeared in that filmâs two\nsequels, Oceanâs Twelve and Oceanâs Thirteen.\nTHE PEKING ACROBATS achieved another milestone in the fall of 2003, when they made their orchestral debut at the Hollywood Bowl in Los Angeles, CA. They performed as part of the\nHollywood Bowlâs Fireworks Season Finale, where the company blended their unique brand of acrobatics with the majestic sound of the 100-piece Hollywood Bowl Orchestra, conducted by John Mauceri. Since their Hollywood Bowl debut, THE PEKING ACROBATS have performed with many of the most prestigious Symphony Orchestras in North America today. These include the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra; the Ravinia Festival Orchestra, featuring members of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra; the San Diego Symphony Orchestra; the Cincinnati Pops Orchestra; the Buffalo Philharmonic Orchestra; and the San Francisco Symphony Orchestra. THE PEKING ACROBATS return often to the Hollywood Bowl, where they perform with the Hollywood Bowl Orchestra as Special Guest Artists.\nOver their thirty-one year career, THE PEKING ACROBATS have achieved international acclaim, dazzling audiences around the world. In February of 2005, THE PEKING ACROBATS premiered in Italy on a five-week, twelve-city tour. Their opening in Milan became a spectacular media event that was covered nationally by the Italian press. In city after city, THE\nPEKING ACROBATS took stage before sold-out crowds, and the reviews were filled with accolades attesting to their superb performances. Since their Italian debut, THE PEKING\nACROBATS have performed in seven European countries on their six European Tours between 2005 and today.\nTHE PEKING ACROBATS are part of a time-honored Chinese tradition, rooted in centuries of Chinese history and folk art. Tradition demands that each generation of acrobats add its own improvements and embellishments; because of this, high honor is conferred upon those skilled enough to become acrobats. THE PEKING ACROBATS seek to uphold this rich and ancient folk art tradition, bringing it to new technical heights while integrating twenty-first century technology.

They have released three albums (2013, 2015, 2019) and have toured extensively throughout North America, including a sold-out show at the Skirball Centre in Los Angeles in 2019. They have been nominated for four Canadian Folk Music Awards, including Best Traditional Singer and Best Ensemble. The six-piece Toronto-based world music ensemble is fronted by Jewish-IndigenousÂ  powerhouse vocalist and dancer Tamar Ilana, and features the cityâs finest world musicians. They perform in over 20 languages such as Ladino, Spanish, Bulgarian, Macedonian, Hebrew, French, Romani and Arabic, drawing inspiration from todayâs worldwide themes of migration and the questioning of oneâs identity.Â \r\n\r\nTamarâs childhood was spent gathering songs from small villages on the edge of the Mediterranean and dancing flamenco, and Ventanasâ band members are from across the globe. Together, and in true Canadian fashion, they intertwine their musical cultures to create an all-encompassing world of their own in which they lead audiences down the less traveled paths of the Mediterranean, mixing in contemporary interpretations of ancient ballads, original compositions and new choreographies, inviting audiences of all backgrounds into their lives and music.\r\n\r\nThroughout the pandemic, Ventanas served as the house band for the new performing arts organization, FabCollab and the Women in Song series, collaborating with primarily BIPOC world class women artists such as Tara Moneka (Iraq), Eliana Cuevas (Venezuela), OKAN (Cuba), Aline Morales (Brazil), Maryem Tollar (Egypt), Kaeja dâDance (Canada), Dimitra Kahrimanidis (Greece), Nastasia Y (Ukraine) and others, in iconic Toronto venues such as Koerner Hall, the Aga Khan Museum and Lula Lounge. This series was also live-streamed by the National Arts Centre garnering over 100,000 online views.Â \r\n\r\nVentanas has toured throughout Canada, the United States and Colombia.Â \r\n\r\nVentanas lineup:\r\n\r\nTamar Ilana - vocals, dance \r\nDemetri Petsalakis - oud, keys\r\nJessica Deutsch - violin, vocals \r\nBenjamin Barrile - flamenco guitar \r\nTyler Emond - upright and electric bass \r\nDerek Gray - drumset, percussionÂ \r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nTamar Ilana bio\r\n\r\nÂ Tamar Ilana is a Toronto-born multifaceted artist who grew up on stage singing in multiple languages, touring internationally and dancing flamenco since a very young age. Of Jewish-Indigenous-Romanian-Scottish descent, Tamar sings in 20 languages and is most influenced by the Sephardic and Flamenco traditions.Â \r\n\r\nTamarâs music and fierce talent reflect her personal and cultural history growing up in multicultural Toronto; accompanying her ethnomusicologist mother, Dr. Judith Cohen, on village fieldwork expeditions and on stage as a child; and living in Ibiza, Barcelona, Paris and Seville as a teen and young adult. Drawing on these experiences, Tamar founded her world music project, Ventanas, in 2011 with whom she has released three albums and been nominated for four Canadian Folk Music Awards including Best Traditional Singer. Tamar has collaborated with such renowned artists as Jesse Cook, Briga, Eliana Cuevas, Lenka Lichtenberg, Jaffa Road, Sultans of String, the Lemon Bucket Orkestra, and Tara Moneka. A highly sought-after flamenco dancer and singer, Tamar performs with the Esmeralda Enrique Spanish Dance Company, and at the Academy of Spanish Dance. Tamar has also been featured in award-winning, innovative international musicals in New York, San Francisco, Washington DC, the UK and Germany.Â \r\n\r\nIn 2020, Tamar co-founded the presenting arts organization FabCollab, and has since presented over 100 BIPOC women and minority artists at venues such as Koerner Hall and the Aga Khan Museum.

Neither can live in the space of the other but, united through a child whom they each struggle to possess, a beautiful new blossom is formed.\r\n\r\nScene 2\r\nA newbornâs arrival is celebrated by the King and Queen of the Garden of Flowers. Everyone is excited from the lowliest seedlings to the most elegantly scented petals. Birds â handmaidens of the Lilac Fairy â arrive to bestow gifts of Beauty, Purity, and Elegance on the newborn child. The festivities are abruptly interrupted by Carabosse, who is outraged by not having received an invitation to the christening. In retaliation, he casts his spell: the newborn â Aurora â will live for 16 years in the upper world garden, after which she will prick her finger on a spindle and become subsumed as a thorn into the underworld. The Lilac Fairy, arriving late to the celebrations, is unable to reverse the spell, but is instead able to alter it so that Aurora will not become a thorn, but that the world of flowers will fall into a still sleep underneath the hedge of thorns that will rise around them. The spells can only be broken by true loveâs kiss.\r\n\r\nScene 3\r\nHappy-go-lucky knitting and weaving seedlings go about their business until Carabosse crosses their path, sowing discord. Carabosse is on his way to ensure his spell is fulfilled.\r\n\r\nScene 4\r\nCelebrations are underway for Auroraâs sixteenth birthday. Arriving at the party Aurora has now grown into a vibrant and enchanting Rosebud. The young suitors swoon around her. An old lady appears, offering Aurora a beautiful golden spindle; before the King and Queen can take it from her, Aurora pricks her finger. Carabosse reveals himself and claims his prize, but before he can bring Aurora with him the Lilac Fairy arrives with her handmaiden. They fulfill the vow to protect Aurora and put all the flowers to sleep. Deadly weeds and thorns grow around the flowers, a hedge which only one who is pure of heart can get through without becoming entangled.\r\nACT II\r\nScene 1\r\nWith the flower garden long forgotten, new plants and trees have sprung forth. Celebrating the arrival of spring, a party of young revelers enjoys a picnic in a clearing in the forest. Among them there is one who is more distinguished than others named Florimund. The Lilac Fairy, searching for someone able to break the spell on Aurora, seizes the moment and guides him deeper into the forests.\r\n\r\nScene 2\r\nArriving at a lake deep in the forest, Florimund is surrounded by Naiads, water nymphs and servants of the Lilac Fairy. Rising out of the water, the Lilac Fairy conjures a vision that is so true of the beautiful Aurora that it feels real to the touch.\r\n\r\nScene 3\r\nFlorimund, smitten with love, is guided by the Lilac Fairy and plunges deeper into the forest to find the sleeping Aurora. At the edge of the world of Carabosse, the Lilac Fairy can go no further and sends Florimund forward to face the darkness on his own.\r\n\r\nScene 4\r\nCarabosse, jealously guarding his domain, is disturbed by the approaching Florimund and commands his destruction. Florimund almost succumbs to the thorns but at last fights his way through and breaks the spell with true loveâs kiss.\r\n\r\nScene 5\r\nWith the spell broken, the Garden of Flowers blooms anew, bringing birds and flowers to celebrate the union of Aurora and Florimund. Aurora is no longer just a blossom: through the prick of his world, Carabosse still jealously guards the lovely flower we now call a Rose, bestowing the sting of sharp thorns on greedy fingers. The Rose has both flower and thorns, shared by the worlds of Carabosse and the Lilac Fairy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n&nbsp;"

Phil Collins &amp; Genesisâ¦ Live makes you relive the great songs that accompanied the most beautiful moments of your life! From the intimate to the universal, he takes us into the soundtrack of his life, which is also ours... It's a real journey through time, from the beginnings of Genesis to the great popular hits of Phil Collins. Surrounded by his faithful musicians, he shows us how this music has marked and transformed his life and career.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMartin Levac is a singer, drummer, keyboardist and singer-songwriter. Known in Quebec for his performances as the impersonator of British singer-drummer Phil Collins, Martin is nevertheless a jack-of-all-trades musician who loves to embark on new musical projects.Â \r\nBorn in Longueuil in 1971, he began learning the drums at the age of eight, and formed his first band at the age of thirteen! His passion for Phil Collins and Genesis was born during his adolescence, the group being at the height of its popularity during the 80s. Martin went so far as to change his drums from right-handed to left-handed to better reproduce the nuances of his idol's playing. Despite everything, Martin is a lover ofÂ music and he is constantly expanding his musical background by integrating new styles.\r\nHe composed his first songs in 1988, within the groupÂ The BobâsÂ . He participated in the Granby International Song Festival in 1996 and 1998, and was a finalist in both editions. His first album, âLâamour ou le sexeâ, appeared in 2000, followed by âLevacâ in 2001 and âInfluencesâ in 2006, this album being composed during the last tour that Martin would do with a tribute group to the GenesisÂ musicÂ during the Peter Gabriel period.\r\nHaving joined the group in 2002, it was from this moment that Martin professionally impersonated Phil Collins for the first time. He plays drums and vocal harmonies, and performs the songÂ More Fool MeÂ , as Phil did on the showÂ Selling England by the PoundÂ .\r\nDuring that same year, Martin and Phil met for the first time in the studios of radio station CKOI in Montreal, during the promotional tour for theÂ British singer's albumÂ TestifyÂ . In February 2005, Martin and Phil met again in Geneva as part of a tour. Phil spends the day with the band and even takes Martin's place behind the drums for the encore! During his appearance on the Quebec show âEverybody talks about itâ in 2010, Phil recognized Martin as his best interpreter and impersonator, his opinion going in the direction of the public and the critics.\r\nThis recognition allows Martin to share the stage with Phil Collins collaborators. Artists as talented as they are recognized, such as Daryl Stuermer, Ronnie Caryl and Amy Keys, among others.\r\nToday, Martin continues to thrill crowds across Quebec, with his two shows, Phil Collins &amp; Genesis and Collins/Gabriel. When not performing, Martin divides his time between songwriting and teaching vocals and drums.\r\n\r\n\r\n&nbsp;"
