In 1984, Johnny Cash invited Willie Nelson, Waylon Jennings and Kris Kristofferson to play on his Johnny Cash Christmas TV Special that was filmed in Switzerland.  When they got back to the hotel, they started jamming and hanging out and that was how the Highwaymen came to be. The Highwaymen Show pays tribute to the great American Outlaws of Country Music - Johnny Cash, Willie Nelson, Waylon Jennings and Kris Kristofferson. The Show covers all of the greatest hits including “Mama Don't Let Your Babies Grow up to be Cowboys”, “Always on My Mind”,  “Me and Bobby McGee” and  “Folsom Prison Blues”. Don’t miss this trip down memory lane with the look and sound of these iconic superstars: The entire show will feel like an encore!\r\n\r\nClose your eyes and you’re right back there…You’ll hear all the hits, remarkably replicated, in this spectacular show!"

Some may remember Kevin from his days singing with the Clancy Brothers.\r\n\r\nCanada has been home to the Irish Rovers since its inception in the early 60s. Millar says, “It’s been a bit odd, being from both Ireland and Canada. The fans have found it confusing as well.” This lead to the song “Band Without A Country” from the Rovers’ 2020 album “Saints And Sinners”.

That album and ‘lucky little ditty’ of a title track written by Shel Silverstein, took them from folk clubs of America to concert halls and television sets worldwide. The band returned to the charts 15 more times, nevertheless, the magic of The Unicorn remained. To pay appropriate tribute on its Gold Anniversary in 2017, the Rovers released “The Unicorn, The Continuing Story” with new recordings of the original Unicorn album, plus the sequel to The Unicorn song, which gave us the answer to an age old question: What happened to the Unicorns when the ark left them stranded on the shore?” VIDEO: https://youtu.be/jB3MKGCRfRA  \r\n\r\nIn the 70’s, the Rovers were the first Irish band to play the Grand Ole Opry, and in '71 they began hosting one of their three international television series, ‘The Irish Rovers show’ for CBC. The show ran seven seasons and won the ACTRA Award for best Variety Performance. During the 80’s there were two more international series, 'The Rovers Comedy House' and 'Party With The Rovers' which ran for another seven years and likely the only show to beat Hockey Night in Canada in the ratings! During this time they became so much a part of the Canadian culture that PM Pierre Elliott Trudeau asked them to become Canadian citizens so they could represent Canada around the world. They accepted the honour, became citizens, and subsequently represented Canada at five World Expos.\r\n\r\nSince 2010 the band has returned to the small screen with three international television specials, The Irish Rovers 50th Anniversary, The Irish Rovers Christmas and The Irish Rovers Home In Ireland which took us back to the same spots back home they visited in the early years of the CBC series. The Rovers continue to sell out concert halls worldwide with their music climbing the charts on Spotify and going viral on YouTube, subsequently gaining them another few generations of followers.\r\n\r\nOver the years, Ireland has felt the impact of The Irish Rovers’ long career of bringing Ireland and Irish music to the rest of the world. Recently, the Rovers were honoured in both Ballymena N. Ireland and Dublin Ireland for all they have done over the years for the music industry and promoting Ireland across North America and beyond. Dublin’s EPIC Museum Director Mervyn Greene refers to The Irish Rovers as ‘one of Ireland’s greatest émigrés’. \r\n\r\nOriginal Irish Rovers, Will Millar, Wilcil McDowell are retired from the band, but George Millar still fronts the band he founded in 1963 with his best pal, the late Jimmy Ferguson."

The song and video tells their story from Ireland to Toronto and beyond, VIDEO: https://youtu.be/ly4ubkByY7k\n1968 – 2023 a few of their honours …\n1968 Winner, RPM Gold Leaf Award (predecessor to JUNOS), “Folk Group of the Year” \n1968 Nomination GRAMMY Award, “Folk Performance of the Year”.\n1971 Winner ACTRA Award for Best Variety Performance\n1971 Winner RPM Gold Leaf Award, Outstanding Record Sales \n1975 Nomination JUNO Award, Best Album Cover, “Emigrate!

That album and ‘lucky little ditty’ of a title track written by Shel Silverstein, took them from folk clubs of America to concert halls and television sets worldwide. The band returned to the charts 15 more times, nevertheless, the magic of The Unicorn remained. To pay appropriate tribute on its Gold Anniversary in 2017, the Rovers released “The Unicorn, The Continuing Story” with new recordings of the original Unicorn album, plus the sequel to The Unicorn song, which gave us the answer to an age old question: What happened to the Unicorns when the ark left them stranded on the shore?” VIDEO: https://youtu.be/jB3MKGCRfRA  \nIn the 70’s, the Rovers were the first Irish band to play the Grand Ole Opry, and in ’71 they began hosting one of their three international television series, ‘The Irish Rovers show’ for CBC. The show ran seven seasons and won the ACTRA Award for best Variety Performance. During the 80’s there were two more international series, ‘The Rovers Comedy House’ and ‘Party With The Rovers’ which ran for another seven years and likely the only show to beat Hockey Night in Canada in the ratings! During this time they became so much a part of the Canadian culture that PM Pierre Elliott Trudeau asked them to become Canadian citizens so they could represent Canada around the world. They accepted the honour, became citizens, and subsequently represented Canada at five World Expos.\nSince 2010 the band has returned to the small screen with three international television specials, The Irish Rovers 50th Anniversary, The Irish Rovers Christmas and The Irish Rovers Home In Ireland which took us back to the same spots back home they visited in the early years of the CBC series. The Rovers continue to sell out concert halls worldwide with their music climbing the charts on Spotify and going viral on YouTube, subsequently gaining them another few generations of followers.\nOver the years, Ireland has felt the impact of The Irish Rovers’ long career of bringing Ireland and Irish music to the rest of the world. Recently, the Rovers were honoured in both Ballymena N. Ireland and Dublin Ireland for all they have done over the years for the music industry and promoting Ireland across North America and beyond. Dublin’s EPIC Museum Director Mervyn Greene refers to The Irish Rovers as ‘one of Ireland’s greatest émigrés’. \nOriginal Irish Rovers, Will Millar, Wilcil McDowell are retired from the band, but George Millar still fronts the band he founded in 1963 with his best pal, the late Jimmy Ferguson.\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t"

        "@value": "The title of William Shakespeare’s As You Like It holds a double meaning that teasingly suggests this is a play to please all tastes. Is that possible? \r\n\r\nCalled “sly, funny, and charming” by the Toronto Star, As You Like It Or The Land Acknowledgement by cultural provocateur Cliff Cardinal, is a devastating yet laugh-out-loud examination of land acknowledgements as cultural and political practice. A timeless tale of mistaken identities, banishment, and forgiveness takes on an entirely new meaning in this subversive update of the Bard’s classic. Cardinal’s Cree and Lakota heritage deeply inform his take on the play, which is acerbic, mischievous, and fearlessly deals with difficult subject matter.\r\n\r\n“The Canadian arts surprise of the year” (The Globe and Mai), William Shakespeare’s As You Like It, A Radical Retelling by Cliff Cardinal was the recipient the prestigious Governor General’s Literary Award for Drama and was shortlisted for the Ontario Trillium Book Award.\r\n\r\n“One thing’s certain: this As You Like It is unlike any other production of the play, past or future.”   NOW Magazine\r\n\r\nAges 14+\r\n\r\nCliff Cardinal – Creator and Writer\r\nNamed by The Globe and Mail as a Canadian Cultural Icon in 2022, Cliff Cardinal is a polarizing writer and performer known for his black humour and compassionate poeticism. His AS YOU LIKE IT, A RADICAL RETELLING has been performed across Canada, was shortlisted for the Ontario Trillium Book Award, and was the recipient of the prestigious Governor General’s Literary Award for Drama. Other solo theatre productions including Stitch, Huff, Cliff Cardinal’s CBC Special, and (Everyone I Love Has) A Terrible Fate (Befall Them) have toured across Canada and won numerous awards. He is an associate artist at VideoCabaret where he develops his new work. Born on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation, he studied\r\nplaywriting at the National Theatre School of Canada and fronts the hilarious and nefarious Cliff Cardinal and The Skylarks.\r\n\r\nCardinal’s first multi-character play, Too Good To Be True, opened VideoCabaret’s 2019 season at The Busy Street Theatre in Toronto with Cardinal himself directing. A workshop version of the script debuted at Summerworks ’13, where NOW Magazine said, “This captivating tale of an off-grid mother and her desperate children solidifies Cardinal as one of the most talented and intriguing writers in the country.” Prior to premiering AS YOU LIKE IT, A RADICAL RETELLING, Cardinal was best known for his one-man play Huff, which he has performed over 200 times. This harrowing yet hilarious show about youth who abuse solvent, at high risk of suicide won the Buddies in Bad Times’ Vanguard Award for Risk and Innovation, two Dora Mavor Moore Awards (Outstanding Performance, Outstanding New Play), RBC’s Emerging Playwright Award, The Lustrum Award (which recognizes the greatest moments at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival) and was shortlisted for Amnesty International’s Freedom of Expression Award. The production garnered a five-star review in The\r\nGuardian Observer titled “a hard-hitting tour de force.” Huff has been published, translated into French, continues to tour, and was released as a podcast by the CBC.\r\n\r\nCliff Cardinal’s CBC Special, a songwriter/storyteller performance, toured festivals in Ottawa, Calgary, St. Catharines, through Canada’s North starting in Yellowknife with a stint at Theatre Kingston and won the Jon Kaplan Spotlight Award for the top performance at Toronto’s SummerWorks Festival. Cliff Cardinal and The Skylarks’ first recording, This is Not a Mistake was released in 2016 and their follow up Gonna Be Fine was released in 2020, both are available online.

Cardinal’s Cree and Lakota heritage deeply inform his take on the play, which is acerbic, mischievous, and fearlessly deals with difficult subject matter.\n“The Canadian arts surprise of the year” (The Globe and Mai), William Shakespeare’s As You Like It, A Radical Retelling by Cliff Cardinal was the recipient the prestigious Governor General’s Literary Award for Drama and was shortlisted for the Ontario Trillium Book Award.\n“One thing’s certain: this As You Like It is unlike any other production of the play, past or future.”   NOW Magazine\nAges 14+\nCliff Cardinal – Creator and Writer\nNamed by The Globe and Mail as a Canadian Cultural Icon in 2022, Cliff Cardinal is a polarizing writer and performer known for his black humour and compassionate poeticism. His AS YOU LIKE IT, A RADICAL RETELLING has been performed across Canada, was shortlisted for the Ontario Trillium Book Award, and was the recipient of the prestigious Governor General’s Literary Award for Drama. Other solo theatre productions including Stitch, Huff, Cliff Cardinal’s CBC Special, and (Everyone I Love Has) A Terrible Fate (Befall Them) have toured across Canada and won numerous awards. He is an associate artist at VideoCabaret where he develops his new work. Born on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation, he studied\nplaywriting at the National Theatre School of Canada and fronts the hilarious and nefarious Cliff Cardinal and The Skylarks.\nCardinal’s first multi-character play, Too Good To Be True, opened VideoCabaret’s 2019 season at The Busy Street Theatre in Toronto with Cardinal himself directing. A workshop version of the script debuted at Summerworks ’13, where NOW Magazine said, “This captivating tale of an off-grid mother and her desperate children solidifies Cardinal as one of the most talented and intriguing writers in the country.” Prior to premiering AS YOU LIKE IT, A RADICAL RETELLING, Cardinal was best known for his one-man play Huff, which he has performed over 200 times. This harrowing yet hilarious show about youth who abuse solvent, at high risk of suicide won the Buddies in Bad Times’ Vanguard Award for Risk and Innovation, two Dora Mavor Moore Awards (Outstanding Performance, Outstanding New Play), RBC’s Emerging Playwright Award, The Lustrum Award (which recognizes the greatest moments at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival) and was shortlisted for Amnesty International’s Freedom of Expression Award. The production garnered a five-star review in The\nGuardian Observer titled “a hard-hitting tour de force.” Huff has been published, translated into French, continues to tour, and was released as a podcast by the CBC.\nCliff Cardinal’s CBC Special, a songwriter/storyteller performance, toured festivals in Ottawa, Calgary, St. Catharines, through Canada’s North starting in Yellowknife with a stint at Theatre Kingston and won the Jon Kaplan Spotlight Award for the top performance at Toronto’s SummerWorks Festival. Cliff Cardinal and The Skylarks’ first recording, This is Not a Mistake was released in 2016 and their follow up Gonna Be Fine was released in 2020, both are available online.

I’ve NEVER seen anything like that!”  \nDISNEY: “Absolutely FANTASTIC!”\nCBC: “HEAD-SCRATCHING MAGIC!” \nPENN & TELLER: “There’s a WILDNESS and beauty to Chris Funk’s daft and funny presence that we – and the audiences we’ve seen him with – find IRRESISTIBLE.”  PENN & TELLER\n\n \n\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t"

This is a man who embodies pluck and wit, lighthearted yet encumbered, and a naivete that somehow remains endearing.  As Derek says:  In the grand contest of life, he stands proudly as a bona fide \"participant.\"\r\n\r\nWell ... truth be told, there’s a lot more to it than that.  From Vegas to St. John's, this Just For Laughs veteran is universally considered to be among the comic elite. Certainly his peers think so, as evidenced by the fact that he's a four-time nominee, and winner of Best Standup Comic - Canadian Comedy Awards, as well as a multiple Gemini nominee for Best Performance in a Comedy. As Rick Mercer says, \"Everyone knows Derek is the funniest man in Canada.\"\r\n\r\nClearly the critics agree: \"5 STARS - the funniest man on earth\" - Winnipeg Free Press; \"4 STARS - the crowd howled\" - Victoria Times Colonist; \"still the funniest man in Canada\" - Toronto Sun; \"Edwards reigns as the King of Canadian comedy\" - Charlottetown Guardian; \"Derek Edwards is hysterical\" - Calgary Sun; \"Edwards takes stand-up to next stage\" - Georgia Straight; \"the epitome of timing &amp; storytelling\" - Halifax Chronicle Herald; \"the comedian's comedian\" - London Free Press.\r\n\r\nSo come on out and join Derek for his latest show, Oxy Moron, as it makes its way across Canada. Expect a night of perceptive guesswork and charmingly misguided jabs from a cherished performer. Enjoy some hearty laughs, a sprinkling of wisdom, and the pleasure of mingling with fellow humans. It's a triple win!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor more info &amp; comedy clips, visit www.shantero.com"

This is a man who embodies pluck and wit, lighthearted yet encumbered, and a naivete that somehow remains endearing.  As Derek says:  In the grand contest of life, he stands proudly as a bona fide “participant.”\nWell … truth be told, there’s a lot more to it than that.  From Vegas to St. John’s, this Just For Laughs veteran is universally considered to be among the comic elite. Certainly his peers think so, as evidenced by the fact that he’s a four-time nominee, and winner of Best Standup Comic – Canadian Comedy Awards, as well as a multiple Gemini nominee for Best Performance in a Comedy. As Rick Mercer says, “Everyone knows Derek is the funniest man in Canada.”\nClearly the critics agree: “5 STARS – the funniest man on earth” – Winnipeg Free Press; “4 STARS – the crowd howled” – Victoria Times Colonist; “still the funniest man in Canada” – Toronto Sun; “Edwards reigns as the King of Canadian comedy” – Charlottetown Guardian; “Derek Edwards is hysterical” – Calgary Sun; “Edwards takes stand-up to next stage” – Georgia Straight; “the epitome of timing & storytelling” – Halifax Chronicle Herald; “the comedian’s comedian” – London Free Press.\nSo come on out and join Derek for his latest show, Oxy Moron, as it makes its way across Canada. Expect a night of perceptive guesswork and charmingly misguided jabs from a cherished performer. Enjoy some hearty laughs, a sprinkling of wisdom, and the pleasure of mingling with fellow humans. It’s a triple win!\n\nFor more info & comedy clips, visit www.shantero.com\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tPerformer's Website Page\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tDerek Edwards: OXY MORON - Official Website\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t"

        "@value": "THE PEKING ACROBATS®\r\n\r\nFor the last thirty two years, THE PEKING ACROBATS® have redefined audience perceptions of Chinese acrobatics. They perform daring maneuvers atop a precarious pagoda of chairs and display their technical prowess at such arts as trick-cycling, precision tumbling, juggling, somersaulting, and gymnastics. They push the limits of human ability, defying gravity with\r\namazing displays of contortion, flexibility, and control. THE PEKING ACROBATS are often accompanied by live musicians who skillfully play traditional Chinese instruments; the time-\r\nhonored Chinese music coalesces with high-tech special effects and awe-inspiring acrobatic feats, creating an exuberant entertainment event with the festive pageantry of a Chinese Carnival.\r\n\r\nSince their founding in 1986, THE PEKING ACROBATS have been featured on numerous television shows and celebrity-studded TV specials. These include Nickelodeon’s Unfabulous, Ellen’s Really Big Show (hosted by Ellen DeGeneres), The Wayne Brady Show, That’s Incredible, ABC's Wide World of Sports, and NBC's Ring In The New Year Holiday Special. They have also appeared on HDNet TV's In Focusseries, and have appeared regularly in 3D on NBC/Comcast's new 3D Channel. THE PEKING ACROBATS set the world record for the Human Chair Stack on FOX Network's Guinness Book Primetime television show in 1999: they balanced six people precariously atop six chairs twenty one feet up in the air without safety lines, astounding audiences with their bravery and dexterity. THE PEKING ACROBATS have also made their way onto the silver screen – company members were featured in Steven Soderbergh's hit film Ocean's Eleven playing alongside Julia Roberts, Brad Pitt and George Clooney. PEKING ACROBATS' alumnus Shaobo Qin also appeared in that film's two\r\nsequels, Ocean's Twelve and Ocean's Thirteen.\r\n\r\nTHE PEKING ACROBATS achieved another milestone in the fall of 2003, when they made their orchestral debut at the Hollywood Bowl in Los Angeles, CA. They performed as part of the\r\nHollywood Bowl’s Fireworks Season Finale, where the company blended their unique brand of acrobatics with the majestic sound of the 100-piece Hollywood Bowl Orchestra, conducted by John Mauceri. Since their Hollywood Bowl debut, THE PEKING ACROBATS have performed with many of the most prestigious Symphony Orchestras in North America today. These include the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra; the Ravinia Festival Orchestra, featuring members of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra; the San Diego Symphony Orchestra; the Cincinnati Pops Orchestra; the Buffalo Philharmonic Orchestra; and the San Francisco Symphony Orchestra. THE PEKING ACROBATS return often to the Hollywood Bowl, where they perform with the Hollywood Bowl Orchestra as Special Guest Artists.\r\n\r\nOver their thirty-one year career, THE PEKING ACROBATS have achieved international acclaim, dazzling audiences around the world. In February of 2005, THE PEKING ACROBATS premiered in Italy on a five-week, twelve-city tour. Their opening in Milan became a spectacular media event that was covered nationally by the Italian press. In city after city, THE\r\nPEKING ACROBATS took stage before sold-out crowds, and the reviews were filled with accolades attesting to their superb performances. Since their Italian debut, THE PEKING\r\nACROBATS have performed in seven European countries on their six European Tours between 2005 and today.\r\n\r\nTHE PEKING ACROBATS are part of a time-honored Chinese tradition, rooted in centuries of Chinese history and folk art. Tradition demands that each generation of acrobats add its own improvements and embellishments; because of this, high honor is conferred upon those skilled enough to become acrobats. THE PEKING ACROBATS seek to uphold this rich and ancient folk art tradition, bringing it to new technical heights while integrating twenty-first century technology. In the words of Clive Davis of the New York Post, \"THE PEKING ACROBATS [are] pushing the envelope of human possibility,” combining agility and grace in remarkable feats of “pure artistry.”"

They perform daring maneuvers atop a precarious pagoda of chairs and display their technical prowess at such arts as trick-cycling, precision tumbling, juggling, somersaulting, and gymnastics. They push the limits of human ability, defying gravity with\namazing displays of contortion, flexibility, and control. THE PEKING ACROBATS are often accompanied by live musicians who skillfully play traditional Chinese instruments; the time-\nhonored Chinese music coalesces with high-tech special effects and awe-inspiring acrobatic feats, creating an exuberant entertainment event with the festive pageantry of a Chinese Carnival.\nSince their founding in 1986, THE PEKING ACROBATS have been featured on numerous television shows and celebrity-studded TV specials. These include Nickelodeon’s Unfabulous, Ellen’s Really Big Show (hosted by Ellen DeGeneres), The Wayne Brady Show, That’s Incredible, ABC’s Wide World of Sports, and NBC’s Ring In The New Year Holiday Special. They have also appeared on HDNet TV’s In Focusseries, and have appeared regularly in 3D on NBC/Comcast’s new 3D Channel. THE PEKING ACROBATS set the world record for the Human Chair Stack on FOX Network’s Guinness Book Primetime television show in 1999: they balanced six people precariously atop six chairs twenty one feet up in the air without safety lines, astounding audiences with their bravery and dexterity. THE PEKING ACROBATS have also made their way onto the silver screen – company members were featured in Steven Soderbergh’s hit film Ocean’s Eleven playing alongside Julia Roberts, Brad Pitt and George Clooney. PEKING ACROBATS’ alumnus Shaobo Qin also appeared in that film’s two\nsequels, Ocean’s Twelve and Ocean’s Thirteen.\nTHE PEKING ACROBATS achieved another milestone in the fall of 2003, when they made their orchestral debut at the Hollywood Bowl in Los Angeles, CA. They performed as part of the\nHollywood Bowl’s Fireworks Season Finale, where the company blended their unique brand of acrobatics with the majestic sound of the 100-piece Hollywood Bowl Orchestra, conducted by John Mauceri. Since their Hollywood Bowl debut, THE PEKING ACROBATS have performed with many of the most prestigious Symphony Orchestras in North America today. These include the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra; the Ravinia Festival Orchestra, featuring members of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra; the San Diego Symphony Orchestra; the Cincinnati Pops Orchestra; the Buffalo Philharmonic Orchestra; and the San Francisco Symphony Orchestra. THE PEKING ACROBATS return often to the Hollywood Bowl, where they perform with the Hollywood Bowl Orchestra as Special Guest Artists.\nOver their thirty-one year career, THE PEKING ACROBATS have achieved international acclaim, dazzling audiences around the world. In February of 2005, THE PEKING ACROBATS premiered in Italy on a five-week, twelve-city tour. Their opening in Milan became a spectacular media event that was covered nationally by the Italian press. In city after city, THE\nPEKING ACROBATS took stage before sold-out crowds, and the reviews were filled with accolades attesting to their superb performances. Since their Italian debut, THE PEKING\nACROBATS have performed in seven European countries on their six European Tours between 2005 and today.\nTHE PEKING ACROBATS are part of a time-honored Chinese tradition, rooted in centuries of Chinese history and folk art. Tradition demands that each generation of acrobats add its own improvements and embellishments; because of this, high honor is conferred upon those skilled enough to become acrobats. THE PEKING ACROBATS seek to uphold this rich and ancient folk art tradition, bringing it to new technical heights while integrating twenty-first century technology.

        "@value": "Tamar Ilana + Ventanas\r\n\r\nFounded in 2011, Ventanas interweaves flamenco, Sephardic and Balkan music and dance, and their own original compositions. They have released three albums (2013, 2015, 2019) and have toured extensively throughout North America, including a sold-out show at the Skirball Centre in Los Angeles in 2019. They have been nominated for four Canadian Folk Music Awards, including Best Traditional Singer and Best Ensemble. The six-piece Toronto-based world music ensemble is fronted by Jewish-Indigenous  powerhouse vocalist and dancer Tamar Ilana, and features the city’s finest world musicians. They perform in over 20 languages such as Ladino, Spanish, Bulgarian, Macedonian, Hebrew, French, Romani and Arabic, drawing inspiration from today’s worldwide themes of migration and the questioning of one’s identity. \r\n\r\nTamar’s childhood was spent gathering songs from small villages on the edge of the Mediterranean and dancing flamenco, and Ventanas’ band members are from across the globe. Together, and in true Canadian fashion, they intertwine their musical cultures to create an all-encompassing world of their own in which they lead audiences down the less traveled paths of the Mediterranean, mixing in contemporary interpretations of ancient ballads, original compositions and new choreographies, inviting audiences of all backgrounds into their lives and music.\r\n\r\nThroughout the pandemic, Ventanas served as the house band for the new performing arts organization, FabCollab and the Women in Song series, collaborating with primarily BIPOC world class women artists such as Tara Moneka (Iraq), Eliana Cuevas (Venezuela), OKAN (Cuba), Aline Morales (Brazil), Maryem Tollar (Egypt), Kaeja d’Dance (Canada), Dimitra Kahrimanidis (Greece), Nastasia Y (Ukraine) and others, in iconic Toronto venues such as Koerner Hall, the Aga Khan Museum and Lula Lounge. This series was also live-streamed by the National Arts Centre garnering over 100,000 online views. \r\n\r\nVentanas has toured throughout Canada, the United States and Colombia. \r\n\r\nVentanas lineup:\r\n\r\nTamar Ilana - vocals, dance \r\nDemetri Petsalakis - oud, keys\r\nJessica Deutsch - violin, vocals \r\nBenjamin Barrile - flamenco guitar \r\nTyler Emond - upright and electric bass \r\nDerek Gray - drumset, percussion \r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nTamar Ilana bio\r\n\r\n Tamar Ilana is a Toronto-born multifaceted artist who grew up on stage singing in multiple languages, touring internationally and dancing flamenco since a very young age. Of Jewish-Indigenous-Romanian-Scottish descent, Tamar sings in 20 languages and is most influenced by the Sephardic and Flamenco traditions. \r\n\r\nTamar’s music and fierce talent reflect her personal and cultural history growing up in multicultural Toronto; accompanying her ethnomusicologist mother, Dr. Judith Cohen, on village fieldwork expeditions and on stage as a child; and living in Ibiza, Barcelona, Paris and Seville as a teen and young adult. Drawing on these experiences, Tamar founded her world music project, Ventanas, in 2011 with whom she has released three albums and been nominated for four Canadian Folk Music Awards including Best Traditional Singer. Tamar has collaborated with such renowned artists as Jesse Cook, Briga, Eliana Cuevas, Lenka Lichtenberg, Jaffa Road, Sultans of String, the Lemon Bucket Orkestra, and Tara Moneka. A highly sought-after flamenco dancer and singer, Tamar performs with the Esmeralda Enrique Spanish Dance Company, and at the Academy of Spanish Dance. Tamar has also been featured in award-winning, innovative international musicals in New York, San Francisco, Washington DC, the UK and Germany. \r\n\r\nIn 2020, Tamar co-founded the presenting arts organization FabCollab, and has since presented over 100 BIPOC women and minority artists at venues such as Koerner Hall and the Aga Khan Museum.

Neither can live in the space of the other but, united through a child whom they each struggle to possess, a beautiful new blossom is formed.\r\n\r\nScene 2\r\nA newborn’s arrival is celebrated by the King and Queen of the Garden of Flowers. Everyone is excited from the lowliest seedlings to the most elegantly scented petals. Birds – handmaidens of the Lilac Fairy – arrive to bestow gifts of Beauty, Purity, and Elegance on the newborn child. The festivities are abruptly interrupted by Carabosse, who is outraged by not having received an invitation to the christening. In retaliation, he casts his spell: the newborn – Aurora – will live for 16 years in the upper world garden, after which she will prick her finger on a spindle and become subsumed as a thorn into the underworld. The Lilac Fairy, arriving late to the celebrations, is unable to reverse the spell, but is instead able to alter it so that Aurora will not become a thorn, but that the world of flowers will fall into a still sleep underneath the hedge of thorns that will rise around them. The spells can only be broken by true love’s kiss.\r\n\r\nScene 3\r\nHappy-go-lucky knitting and weaving seedlings go about their business until Carabosse crosses their path, sowing discord. Carabosse is on his way to ensure his spell is fulfilled.\r\n\r\nScene 4\r\nCelebrations are underway for Aurora’s sixteenth birthday. Arriving at the party Aurora has now grown into a vibrant and enchanting Rosebud. The young suitors swoon around her. An old lady appears, offering Aurora a beautiful golden spindle; before the King and Queen can take it from her, Aurora pricks her finger. Carabosse reveals himself and claims his prize, but before he can bring Aurora with him the Lilac Fairy arrives with her handmaiden. They fulfill the vow to protect Aurora and put all the flowers to sleep. Deadly weeds and thorns grow around the flowers, a hedge which only one who is pure of heart can get through without becoming entangled.\r\nACT II\r\nScene 1\r\nWith the flower garden long forgotten, new plants and trees have sprung forth. Celebrating the arrival of spring, a party of young revelers enjoys a picnic in a clearing in the forest. Among them there is one who is more distinguished than others named Florimund. The Lilac Fairy, searching for someone able to break the spell on Aurora, seizes the moment and guides him deeper into the forests.\r\n\r\nScene 2\r\nArriving at a lake deep in the forest, Florimund is surrounded by Naiads, water nymphs and servants of the Lilac Fairy. Rising out of the water, the Lilac Fairy conjures a vision that is so true of the beautiful Aurora that it feels real to the touch.\r\n\r\nScene 3\r\nFlorimund, smitten with love, is guided by the Lilac Fairy and plunges deeper into the forest to find the sleeping Aurora. At the edge of the world of Carabosse, the Lilac Fairy can go no further and sends Florimund forward to face the darkness on his own.\r\n\r\nScene 4\r\nCarabosse, jealously guarding his domain, is disturbed by the approaching Florimund and commands his destruction. Florimund almost succumbs to the thorns but at last fights his way through and breaks the spell with true love’s kiss.\r\n\r\nScene 5\r\nWith the spell broken, the Garden of Flowers blooms anew, bringing birds and flowers to celebrate the union of Aurora and Florimund. Aurora is no longer just a blossom: through the prick of his world, Carabosse still jealously guards the lovely flower we now call a Rose, bestowing the sting of sharp thorns on greedy fingers. The Rose has both flower and thorns, shared by the worlds of Carabosse and the Lilac Fairy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n&nbsp;"

Neither can live in the space of the other but, united through a child whom they each struggle to possess, a beautiful new blossom is formed.\nScene 2\nA newborn’s arrival is celebrated by the King and Queen of the Garden of Flowers. Everyone is excited from the lowliest seedlings to the most elegantly scented petals. Birds – handmaidens of the Lilac Fairy – arrive to bestow gifts of Beauty, Purity, and Elegance on the newborn child. The festivities are abruptly interrupted by Carabosse, who is outraged by not having received an invitation to the christening. In retaliation, he casts his spell: the newborn – Aurora – will live for 16 years in the upper world garden, after which she will prick her finger on a spindle and become subsumed as a thorn into the underworld. The Lilac Fairy, arriving late to the celebrations, is unable to reverse the spell, but is instead able to alter it so that Aurora will not become a thorn, but that the world of flowers will fall into a still sleep underneath the hedge of thorns that will rise around them. The spells can only be broken by true love’s kiss.\nScene 3\nHappy-go-lucky knitting and weaving seedlings go about their business until Carabosse crosses their path, sowing discord. Carabosse is on his way to ensure his spell is fulfilled.\nScene 4\nCelebrations are underway for Aurora’s sixteenth birthday. Arriving at the party Aurora has now grown into a vibrant and enchanting Rosebud. The young suitors swoon around her. An old lady appears, offering Aurora a beautiful golden spindle; before the King and Queen can take it from her, Aurora pricks her finger. Carabosse reveals himself and claims his prize, but before he can bring Aurora with him the Lilac Fairy arrives with her handmaiden. They fulfill the vow to protect Aurora and put all the flowers to sleep. Deadly weeds and thorns grow around the flowers, a hedge which only one who is pure of heart can get through without becoming entangled.\nACT II\nScene 1\nWith the flower garden long forgotten, new plants and trees have sprung forth.

        "@value": "Martin Levac: Phil Collins &amp; Genesis… Live\r\nMartin Levac continues the journey into the combined universe of Phil Collins &amp; Genesis in a new show! Phil Collins &amp; Genesis… Live makes you relive the great songs that accompanied the most beautiful moments of your life! From the intimate to the universal, he takes us into the soundtrack of his life, which is also ours... It's a real journey through time, from the beginnings of Genesis to the great popular hits of Phil Collins. Surrounded by his faithful musicians, he shows us how this music has marked and transformed his life and career.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMartin Levac is a singer, drummer, keyboardist and singer-songwriter. Known in Quebec for his performances as the impersonator of British singer-drummer Phil Collins, Martin is nevertheless a jack-of-all-trades musician who loves to embark on new musical projects. \r\nBorn in Longueuil in 1971, he began learning the drums at the age of eight, and formed his first band at the age of thirteen! His passion for Phil Collins and Genesis was born during his adolescence, the group being at the height of its popularity during the 80s. Martin went so far as to change his drums from right-handed to left-handed to better reproduce the nuances of his idol's playing. Despite everything, Martin is a lover of music and he is constantly expanding his musical background by integrating new styles.\r\nHe composed his first songs in 1988, within the group The Bob’s . He participated in the Granby International Song Festival in 1996 and 1998, and was a finalist in both editions. His first album, “L’amour ou le sexe”, appeared in 2000, followed by “Levac” in 2001 and “Influences” in 2006, this album being composed during the last tour that Martin would do with a tribute group to the Genesis music during the Peter Gabriel period.\r\nHaving joined the group in 2002, it was from this moment that Martin professionally impersonated Phil Collins for the first time. He plays drums and vocal harmonies, and performs the song More Fool Me , as Phil did on the show Selling England by the Pound .\r\nDuring that same year, Martin and Phil met for the first time in the studios of radio station CKOI in Montreal, during the promotional tour for the British singer's album Testify . In February 2005, Martin and Phil met again in Geneva as part of a tour. Phil spends the day with the band and even takes Martin's place behind the drums for the encore! During his appearance on the Quebec show “Everybody talks about it” in 2010, Phil recognized Martin as his best interpreter and impersonator, his opinion going in the direction of the public and the critics.\r\nThis recognition allows Martin to share the stage with Phil Collins collaborators. Artists as talented as they are recognized, such as Daryl Stuermer, Ronnie Caryl and Amy Keys, among others.\r\nToday, Martin continues to thrill crowds across Quebec, with his two shows, Phil Collins &amp; Genesis and Collins/Gabriel. When not performing, Martin divides his time between songwriting and teaching vocals and drums.\r\n\r\n\r\n&nbsp;"

Phil Collins & Genesis… Live makes you relive the great songs that accompanied the most beautiful moments of your life! From the intimate to the universal, he takes us into the soundtrack of his life, which is also ours… It’s a real journey through time, from the beginnings of Genesis to the great popular hits of Phil Collins. Surrounded by his faithful musicians, he shows us how this music has marked and transformed his life and career.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMartin Levac is a singer, drummer, keyboardist and singer-songwriter. Known in Quebec for his performances as the impersonator of British singer-drummer Phil Collins, Martin is nevertheless a jack-of-all-trades musician who loves to embark on new musical projects. \nBorn in Longueuil in 1971, he began learning the drums at the age of eight, and formed his first band at the age of thirteen! His passion for Phil Collins and Genesis was born during his adolescence, the group being at the height of its popularity during the 80s. Martin went so far as to change his drums from right-handed to left-handed to better reproduce the nuances of his idol’s playing. Despite everything, Martin is a lover of music and he is constantly expanding his musical background by integrating new styles.\nHe composed his first songs in 1988, within the group The Bob’s . He participated in the Granby International Song Festival in 1996 and 1998, and was a finalist in both editions. His first album, “L’amour ou le sexe”, appeared in 2000, followed by “Levac” in 2001 and “Influences” in 2006, this album being composed during the last tour that Martin would do with a tribute group to the Genesis music during the Peter Gabriel period.\nHaving joined the group in 2002, it was from this moment that Martin professionally impersonated Phil Collins for the first time. He plays drums and vocal harmonies, and performs the song More Fool Me , as Phil did on the show Selling England by the Pound .\nDuring that same year, Martin and Phil met for the first time in the studios of radio station CKOI in Montreal, during the promotional tour for the British singer’s album Testify . In February 2005, Martin and Phil met again in Geneva as part of a tour. Phil spends the day with the band and even takes Martin’s place behind the drums for the encore! During his appearance on the Quebec show “Everybody talks about it” in 2010, Phil recognized Martin as his best interpreter and impersonator, his opinion going in the direction of the public and the critics.\nThis recognition allows Martin to share the stage with Phil Collins collaborators. Artists as talented as they are recognized, such as Daryl Stuermer, Ronnie Caryl and Amy Keys, among others.\nToday, Martin continues to thrill crowds across Quebec, with his two shows, Phil Collins & Genesis and Collins/Gabriel. When not performing, Martin divides his time between songwriting and teaching vocals and drums.\n\n \n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t"

The group recreates the legendary band in its youthful heyday from 1975-1979. “It’s been said imitation is the sincerest form of flattery. I say THANK YOU!”- Richard Dashut, Record Producer – Fleetwood Mac albums including Rumours, Tusk, Live, Mirage, Tango In The Night, and Time.\nAfter finding huge success in Los Angeles, selling out their regular Roxy Theatre performances month after month, the band moved from the world famous Sunset Strip to Casinos, Theatres, and clubs all over Canada and the United States. Rumours has meticulously put together a show that spares no detail. From period accurate equipment and costumes to spot on characterizations and musical performances, “ Rumours” takes you back to a time when music was still an unbridled cultural experience and bands weren’t afraid to put on a show.\nRelive the rock and roll magic with “Rumours” The Ultimate Fleetwood Mac Tribute Show!\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t"
