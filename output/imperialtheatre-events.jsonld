        "@value": "James Barker Band is proof that big dreams can grow from small-town roots. Fueled by friendship, grit, and a shared love for storytelling, the band has gone from local dive bars to headlining stages across North America and Europe, amassing over 295 million global streams, multiple No. 1 hits, and the unwavering devotion of fans along the way. The story began in 2009 when James Barker (lead vocals/guitar) and Connor Stephen (drums) first met at band camp. Bonded by their passion for music, they teamed up with Taylor Abram (guitar/background vocals) and Bobby Martin (bass), who all grew up within an hour of each other in rural towns surrounding Toronto. The four-piece quickly became close friends, hitting the road in a rented Greyhound bus to play gigs wherever they could, pouring their heart into every note. The band’s big break came in 2015 at the Emerging Artist Showcase at Boots and Hearts Music Festival, where their raw talent and undeniable charm earned them the top prize. That victory was a launchpad, leading to a record deal with Universal Music Canada, the country’s leading music company, and the release of their breakout single, “Lawn Chair Lazy,” in 2017. The laid-back anthem quickly gained traction and earned Platinum certification, but it was just the beginning. Their subsequent singles have also earned vast achievements and acclaim. Their 2x Platinum single “Chills,” charted at No. 1 in Canadian country music charts, peaked at #1 on the Billboard Canada Country chart, #49 on the American Billboard Country Chart, and was awarded Single of the Year and Top Selling Canadian Single of the Year at the 2018 Canadian Country Music Awards, just a year after their major label signing. “Chills” also made history with the SOCAN Songwriter Prize nomination, which is the first-ever country music nomination for this prestigious all-genre award. The record-breaking track’s home album, Game On, is Gold certified and took home the 2018 JUNO Award for Country Album of the Year. Following up on a stellar debut, the band released several fan and industry favourites like Platinum-certified “Keep it Simple” which notched another No. 1 song of the year at the 2020 CCMA Awards and CMAO Awards. Their bustling catalogue has seen a string of successful tracks with four No.1 Canadian Country radio hits - “Chills,” “Over All Over Again,” “Meet Your Mama,” and “New Old Trucks” feat. 14x GRAMMY-nominated artist Dierks Bentley. To date, they’ve racked up 12 Gold and Platinum certifications, four No. 1 Canadian country radio hits, and three CCMA Fans’ Choice Awards. But beyond their record-breaking metrics and awards, James Barker Band’s magic lies in their connection—to each other, to their roots, and to the fans who see themselves in their songs. Every note they play is a tribute to the small towns that raised them, the families that support them, and the communities that keep showing up to cheer them on. With their grounded ethos, infectious energy, and heartfelt storytelling, James Barker Band has made it clear: they’re not just chasing dreams—they’re sharing them. As they continue their rise in Canada, Nashville, and beyond, the band remains the same four humble friends who started it all, proof that sometimes, the best stories come from the simplest beginnings. With this, the multi-award-winning four-piece is continuing its steadfast ascent in Canada, Nashville and beyond. Fans are encouraged to stay up to date with JBB for more exciting announcements on the way, on Instagram, Facebook, TikTok, YouTube and at JamesBarkerBand.com."

Fueled by friendship,\ngrit, and a shared love for storytelling, the band has gone from local dive bars to headlining\nstages across North America and Europe, amassing over 295 million global streams, multiple No.\n1 hits, and the unwavering devotion of fans along the way.\nThe story began in 2009 when James Barker (lead vocals/guitar) and Connor Stephen (drums)\nfirst met at band camp. Bonded by their passion for music, they teamed up with Taylor Abram\n(guitar/background vocals) and Bobby Martin (bass), who all grew up within an hour of each other\nin rural towns surrounding Toronto. The four-piece quickly became close friends, hitting the road\nin a rented Greyhound bus to play gigs wherever they could, pouring their heart into every note.\nThe band’s big break came in 2015 at the Emerging Artist Showcase at Boots and Hearts Music\nFestival, where their raw talent and undeniable charm earned them the top prize. That victory was\na launchpad, leading to a record deal with Universal Music Canada, the country’s leading music\ncompany, and the release of their breakout single, “Lawn Chair Lazy,” in 2017. The laid-back\nanthem quickly gained traction and earned Platinum certification, but it was just the beginning.\nTheir subsequent singles have also earned vast achievements and acclaim. Their 2x Platinum\nsingle “Chills,” charted at No. 1 in Canadian country music charts, peaked at #1 on the Billboard\nCanada Country chart, #49 on the American Billboard Country Chart, and was awarded Single of\nthe Year and Top Selling Canadian Single of the Year at the 2018 Canadian Country Music Awards,\njust a year after their major label signing. “Chills” also made history with the SOCAN Songwriter\nPrize nomination, which is the first-ever country music nomination for this prestigious all-genre\naward. The record-breaking track’s home album, Game On, is Gold certified and took home the\n2018 JUNO Award for Country Album of the Year.\nFollowing up on a stellar debut, the band released several fan and industry favourites like\nPlatinum-certified “Keep it Simple” which notched another No. 1 song of the year at the 2020 CCMA\nAwards and CMAO Awards. Their bustling catalogue has seen a string of successful tracks with\nfour No.1 Canadian Country radio hits – “Chills,” “Over All Over Again,” “Meet Your Mama,” and\n“New Old Trucks” feat. 14x GRAMMY-nominated artist Dierks Bentley. To date, they’ve racked up\n12 Gold and Platinum certifications, four No. 1 Canadian country radio hits, and three CCMA Fans’\nChoice Awards.\nBut beyond their record-breaking metrics and awards, James Barker Band’s magic lies in their\nconnection—to each other, to their roots, and to the fans who see themselves in their songs. Every\nnote they play is a tribute to the small towns that raised them, the families that support them, and\nthe communities that keep showing up to cheer them on. With their grounded ethos, infectious\nenergy, and heartfelt storytelling, James Barker Band has made it clear: they’re not just chasing\ndreams—they’re sharing them. As they continue their rise in Canada, Nashville, and beyond, the\nband remains the same four humble friends who started it all, proof that sometimes, the best\nstories come from the simplest beginnings.\nWith this, the multi-award-winning four-piece is continuing its steadfast ascent in Canada, Nashville\nand beyond. Fans are encouraged to stay up to date with JBB for more exciting announcements\non the way, on Instagram, Facebook, TikTok, YouTube and at JamesBarkerBand.com.\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tPerformer's Website Page\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tJames Barker Band - Official Website\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tPerformer's Facebook Page\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tJames Barker Band on Facebook\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tPerformer's Instagram Page\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tJames Barker Band on Instagram\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t"

        "@value": "DATE MOVED FROM JUNE on May 27th. Rating: Not Rated / Country: Canada / Languages: Englis A committed couple finds their life slipping away, not because they’ve done anything in particular, but because their history is unwriting itself. Sort of. It’s a multiverse picture without a single visual effect, unless you count the actors. Several years after their meet-cute at a wedding, Olive (Caroline Bell) and Benny (Ian Ottis Goff) are spending an entirely ordinary day at their lake house. Until, that is, things start to shift, little by little. At first it’s just an apparently misplaced package or some scrambled letters on the fridge. Then, it’s more meaningful stuff. And then, almost casually, Olive finds Benny replaced by a woman named Ada (Mallory Amirault), who can’t understand why Olive doesn’t know her. They’ve been together for years, after all. Since they met at that wedding. The debut feature from Fredericton filmmaker Arianna Martinez is easier to experience than describe. It’s a multiverse picture without a single visual effect, unless you count the actors. Working from a script she co-wrote with producer Gordon Mihan, Martinez keeps the storytelling clear and coherent even when her characters don’t know what’s happening, using a slightly theatrical style and making the most of a very limited budget. And New Brunswick stage actor and playwright Bell is sensational in her first film role as Olive. She glows — sometimes literally — as a woman slowly realizing she might not have been living the life she wants, and grappling with everything that means."

Sort of. It’s a multiverse picture without a single visual effect, unless you count the actors.\nSeveral years after their meet-cute at a wedding, Olive (Caroline Bell) and Benny (Ian Ottis Goff) are spending an entirely ordinary day at their lake house. Until, that is, things start to shift, little by little. At first it’s just an apparently misplaced package or some scrambled letters on the fridge. Then, it’s more meaningful stuff. And then, almost casually, Olive finds Benny replaced by a woman named Ada (Mallory Amirault), who can’t understand why Olive doesn’t know her. They’ve been together for years, after all. Since they met at that wedding.\nThe debut feature from Fredericton filmmaker Arianna Martinez is easier to experience than describe. It’s a multiverse picture without a single visual effect, unless you count the actors. Working from a script she co-wrote with producer Gordon Mihan, Martinez keeps the storytelling clear and coherent even when her characters don’t know what’s happening, using a slightly theatrical style and making the most of a very limited budget. And New Brunswick stage actor and playwright Bell is sensational in her first film role as Olive. She glows — sometimes literally — as a woman slowly realizing she might not have been living the life she wants, and grappling with everything that means.\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t"

        "@value": "Martin Levac: Phil Collins &amp; Genesis… Live Martin Levac continues the journey into the combined universe of Phil Collins &amp; Genesis in a new show! Phil Collins &amp; Genesis… Live makes you relive the great songs that accompanied the most beautiful moments of your life! From the intimate to the universal, he takes us into the soundtrack of his life, which is also ours... It's a real journey through time, from the beginnings of Genesis to the great popular hits of Phil Collins. Surrounded by his faithful musicians, he shows us how this music has marked and transformed his life and career. Martin Levac is a singer, drummer, keyboardist and singer-songwriter. Known in Quebec for his performances as the impersonator of British singer-drummer Phil Collins, Martin is nevertheless a jack-of-all-trades musician who loves to embark on new musical projects.  Born in Longueuil in 1971, he began learning the drums at the age of eight, and formed his first band at the age of thirteen! His passion for Phil Collins and Genesis was born during his adolescence, the group being at the height of its popularity during the 80s. Martin went so far as to change his drums from right-handed to left-handed to better reproduce the nuances of his idol's playing. Despite everything, Martin is a lover of music and he is constantly expanding his musical background by integrating new styles. He composed his first songs in 1988, within the group The Bob’s . He participated in the Granby International Song Festival in 1996 and 1998, and was a finalist in both editions. His first album, “L’amour ou le sexe”, appeared in 2000, followed by “Levac” in 2001 and “Influences” in 2006, this album being composed during the last tour that Martin would do with a tribute group to the Genesis music during the Peter Gabriel period. Having joined the group in 2002, it was from this moment that Martin professionally impersonated Phil Collins for the first time. He plays drums and vocal harmonies, and performs the song More Fool Me , as Phil did on the show Selling England by the Pound . During that same year, Martin and Phil met for the first time in the studios of radio station CKOI in Montreal, during the promotional tour for the British singer's album Testify . In February 2005, Martin and Phil met again in Geneva as part of a tour. Phil spends the day with the band and even takes Martin's place behind the drums for the encore! During his appearance on the Quebec show “Everybody talks about it” in 2010, Phil recognized Martin as his best interpreter and impersonator, his opinion going in the direction of the public and the critics. This recognition allows Martin to share the stage with Phil Collins collaborators. Artists as talented as they are recognized, such as Daryl Stuermer, Ronnie Caryl and Amy Keys, among others. Today, Martin continues to thrill crowds across Quebec, with his two shows, Phil Collins &amp; Genesis and Collins/Gabriel. When not performing, Martin divides his time between songwriting and teaching vocals and drums. [embed]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d90Qj-jelNk[/embed] &nbsp;"

Filmed at the Warner Theatre in Washington, D.C., Tom holds nothing back, as his kids are finally out of the house and it’s just him, his wife and a bunch of animals ready to return to their glory days. Tom has seen a lot over the years, from close calls with a pachinko ball to late night 7-Eleven runs, and he’s sharing all his thoughts as he parties on into the next stage of life. Papa’s other specials include What A Day!, You’re Doing Great!, Human Mule, Freaked Out and Tom Papa Live in New York City, two of which were directed by Rob Zombie.  In 2023, Tom released his highly anticipated third book, We’re All In This Together…So Make Some Room. The book compiles comedic essays that aim to unite us through our stupidity. Every mistake has already been made, and this should bring us great comfort as we join together in our fight for survival, or at least in our attempt to get through the day. Whether we like it or not, we're all in this together.   In 2020, he released his second book, You’re Doing Great! - And Other Reasons To Stay Alive, which was the follow-up to Your Dad Stole My Rake: And Other Family Dilemmas both released by St Martin’s Press, making “Summer Must Read” lists from Parade Magazine to The New York Post. Tom is also a contributing writer to the New Yorker Magazine.    Tom is the host of the weekly podcast, Breaking Bread with Tom Papa, which features Tom and his guest eating, drinking, and celebrating the true meaning of breaking bread with insightful, revealing and always funny conversations. He also hosts the popular daily Netflix radio show, What A Joke With Papa And Fortune on Sirius XM Channel 93 and the monthly show, Come To Papa Live on Channel 94.   Papa has starred in many fan-favorite films including Paper Spiders where he stared opposite Lily Taylor, The Informant opposite Matt Damon, Analyze That opposite Robert DeNiro, and The Haunted World of El Superbeasto opposite Paul Giamatti, where Tom played the voice of El Superbeasto. He can also be seen alongside Michael Douglas and Matt Damon in the HBO film, Behind the Candelabra, which was directed by Steven Soderbergh and won 11 Emmys. On TV, Tom hosted the NBC series, The Marriage Ref, which ran for two seasons and had a recurring role opposite Julia Louis-Dreyfus on the CBS series, The New Adventures of Old Christine.

The costumes, the music, and the atmosphere is as close to the real thing as you can get. The show suspends belief as it weaves through hit after hit from their classic 60s catalogue to the groove of their 70s disco era hits that made the band a worldwide sensation. Dance and sing along to hits like Stayin Alive, Night Fever, Massachusetts, Tragedy, You Should Be Dancing, and Nights on Broadway. All performed note for note by award-winning vocalists Colum Henry, Dave Lafame, and Aaron Solomon. This international touring act has played to sold out, standing ovation audiences throughout North America. So put on your white suits, sequin dresses, boogie shoes, and get ready to sing and dance the night away with Bee Gees Revisited. If you are a Bee Gees fan, this show is a must see!

No seventies group represented Canada's musical identity to the world like The Stampeders. A quick look at Canada's music scene from 1971 until 1976 confirms The Stampeders were truly the country's international musical ambassadors, touring more extensively in Canada and overseas than any other Canadian group during that time.  In 1977 the trio: Rich Dodson (lead guitar), Kim Berly (drums) and Ronnie King (bass) parted company but reunited, fittingly at the Calgary Stampede, 15 years later in 1992. Since then they’ve been recognized by SOCAN for their Lifetime Achievement, been inducted into the SOCAN Songwriters Hall of Fame on five occasions and the Canadian Songwriters Hall of Fame for their 1971 seminal hit Sweet City Woman. In March 2024, just before the Ontario leg of this tour, Ronnie King passed away.  In the final days, while in  palliative care, he insisted that his band mates carry on.  Dave  Chabot, renowned bassist and long time friend of the band, who was already scheduled to be on the tour to sit in for Ronnie as needed, was the obvious choice.  Still, Ronnie  remains a presence at every show, as Rich and Kim share stories from 50plus years on the road and pay tribute with a retrospective video. The enduring musical legacy of The Stampeders  ... One More Time ... 'better catch a noon train, better get there for a rock 'n' rolling good time!’ [embed]https://youtu.be/gK5Cb0INHYU[/embed]"

Comprised of bassist and vocalist Chris Murphy, guitarists/vocalists Jay Ferguson and Patrick Pentland, and drummer/vocalist Andrew Scott, the quartet possessed a rare chemistry from the start. There are so many moments peppered throughout the 30-year history of Canadian indie rock heroes Sloan that set them well apart from the pack. From the band’s earliest home studio recordings that married their pop smarts with fizzy, fuzzed out guitars, right up to later efforts that contain multitudes in their track listings, ranging from Dylanesque streams of consciousness to short, sharp blasts of power pop - Somehow, it all remains quintessentially Sloan. The band are credited as being a main instigator for the Canadian East Coast alternative scene of the early 90s, garnering comparisons to the Seattle Grunge movement on the opposite coast. Over the course of their quarter-century career, Sloan have amassed an outstanding collection of over 250 songs and more than 30 singles with airplay at Canadian Rock Radio. Sloan have received nine Juno Award nominations and won for Best Alternative Album in 1997. The band was named one of Canada’s top five bands of all-time in a CBC critics poll."

In addition to great jazz standards, the program will feature Peterson's most famous works, such as Place St-Henri, Hymn to Freedom and Cakewalk. As a prelude to the concert, a multimedia presentation will immerse the audience in the world of the jazz master. In addition, Oscar Peterson's youngest daughter, Céline Peterson, will offer an intimate look at her father's life through personal anecdotes. This exceptional event will be a musical celebration and a unique opportunity to pay tribute to one of the world's greatest Canadian music legends, and to experience some unforgettable moments.

        "@value": "Ann Marie Fleming Canada | 2024 | 110m | English Keira Jang, Joel Oulette, and Sandra Oh star in this introspective live-action and animated feature set in the near future when technology and travel are almost completely banned, and nobody is allowed to live past age 50. Eight years since her last feature, filmmaker, writer, and visual artist Ann Marie Fleming brings her gentle, introspective touch to the timely genre of environmental science fiction. Joined by past collaborator Sandra Oh — who voiced and co-produced Fleming’s Window Horses (TIFF ’16) — and elements of her trademark animation, Can I Get a Witness? tells the story of a mother and daughter in a near-future world where huge sacrifices are made to maintain life on Earth. With its resources swallowed by e-waste and overpopulation, the world is experiencing an anthropogenic collapse. To manage, technological advances are shunned. Nobody has electricity and only people with exceptions are permitted cars. Most importantly, there is also a collective agreement that nobody is allowed to live beyond the age of 50. Oh’s Ellie lives with her teenage daughter Kiah (Keira Jang), who is starting her first day as a Documenter, an important role in this new world order. She uses her artistic gifts — beautifully conjured in animations — to draw the dying ceremonies, since printing and photography have been banned. Kiah is paired with Daniel (Joel Oulette), the young man who performs the contractual elements of each person’s end-of-life ceremony. He matter-of-factly provides the packages a person can choose, sets them up when the time comes, and performs the burials. But his new coworker is having a hard time handling the emotional impacts of the job. With Fleming’s deft touch, Can I Get a Witness? is an inspired look at what memories — and catastrophic climate change — might look like.

Known for his innovative guitar solos and thunderous chords, Morello is a groundbreaking artist both in his solo career and as an original member of the rock bands Rage Against the Machine and Audioslave - two acts responsible for multiple Grammy Awards and a combined 30 million albums sold worldwide. His trademark style was a crucial component of Rage Against the Machine, helping launch Morello and the band to Grammy-winning, multi-platinum success, which in turn led to his recognition by Rolling Stone Magazine as the 18th “Greatest Guitar Player of All-Time” and subsequent induction into both the Rock &amp; Roll and Metal Hall of Fame. After not just one but two multi million selling bands, Morello's signature guitar can be heard in the supergroup Prophets of Rage and with his 6-year stint in Bruce Springsteen’s E-Street Band. Morello is a vocal political activist whose first solo outing was as the Nightwatchman. You can often find him on the front line of pickets and strikes across the country - most recently in solidarity with United Mine Workers of America in Brookwood, AL, the United Farm Workers of America in Sacramento, CA, and the Star Garden Strippers Union in North Hollywood, CA. He is also the 2023 Music Will Humanitarian of the Year recipient, helping to sponsor multiple music education programs across the country for schools in need and is an ACLU Artist for Smart Justice for his advocacy work. Additionally, you can catch him every week on Sirius XM as the host of his show “One Man Revolution.” [embed]https://youtu.be/9CkCgnVWJ-8[/embed] &nbsp;"

Experiencing the band GYPSY is truly a musically authentic event.

Don Morash's guitar playing makes you feel like Lindsay Buckingham is in the songs. Aran Hill plays a fretless bass that John McVie would be proud to listen to. Maurice Nadeau, drummer for GYPSY, lays down an excellent beat and even looks a bit like Mick Fleetwood.

        "@value": "CCMA winners, and beloved Canadian country superstars George Canyon and Aaron Pritchett unite for their coast to coast Cowboy Christmas tour. With countless accolades between them, and over 25 years of hits, the pair will come together to treat fans to some of their own chart topping songs, as well as some all-time favorite Christmas classics. Truly a show not to be missed, in celebration of the Holiday season.   GEORGE CANYON   George Canyon rose to becoming one of Canada’s hottest Country Music stars in the early 2000’s and has won countless accolades and awards, including Juno Awards, CCMA Awards, and ECMA Awards to name a few. He has been inducted into the Nova Scotia Country Music Hall of Fame, recorded 12 albums, and was presented a certified Platinum Award for his debut album ‘One Good Friend’. With country iconic hits like Just Like You, I Believe in Angels, Drinkin’ Thinkin’, Daughters of the Sun, I Got This, I Want You To Live, Slow Dance and many, many more, he is also a highly regarded humanitarian, strong supporter of the military, and, most important, a proud father and devoted husband.  Canyon’s tireless work as spokesperson for the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation (JDRF) and his ongoing support for Canada’s Armed Forces has earned him much National and International recognition. Among them, he was honored with the Humanitarian Award by the Canadian Country Music Association, the Queen's Diamond Jubilee Medal, and was also made the first ever Colonel Commandant of the Royal Canadian Air Cadets by the Honourable Peter MacKay, former Minister of National Defense. Outside of his music and charitable work, many people might also recognize George for his numerous roles on the big screen. From Charlie Wells in the hit television show Heartland and the head forest ranger in Trailer Park Boys, to Bull Shelton in the Hallmark Channel’s highest-rated original Christmas movie “One Starry Christmas”. George also guest starred on stage in the musical production of Grease in 2018 at the Winter Garden Theatre in Toronto. Among his many identities, Canyon is also a proud Canadian and huge hockey fan, and roots for his team, the Calgary Flames, for which he is in his sixth season singing the national anthem during the home games. George released his new memoir on November 8th, 2022 with Simon &amp; Schuster Canada, titled ‘My Country’ - a heartfelt and candid memoir charting his humble beginnings in rural Nova Scotia, the hard-won success he found under the bright lights of Nashville, Tennessee, and the life lessons learned on and off the road that ultimately led him home.   AARON PRITCHETT He’s has been a household name in Canadian Country music for 20 years, but when Aaron Pritchett hits the stage, he does so with the energy and intensity of an artist fresh on the scene. Yet despite being known for his dynamic, even raucous, live shows, it’s the classically country gentleman inside of Pritchett that’s made him a fan favourite - and staying force in Canadian country - for more than two decades. With 13 Top Ten hits under hits under his belt [buckle], Pritchett has made a career of seamlessly moving from good ol’ boy anthems like “Hold My Beer” to pop-tinged party pleasers like “Worth a Shot” to heart-string pulling ballads like “Warm Safe Place”. He could have stopped when he had enough to fill a Greatest Hits album - which he did in 2015 - but instead he followed it up with several more including his 2019 #1 single, “Better When I Do”. Throughout it, Pritchett has racked up more than 30 Juno, CCMA, WCMA and BCCMA nominations including multiple wins for Entertainer of the Year, Male Vocalist of the Year and a CCMA SOCAN Songwriter of the Year award. With his writing, Pritchett continues to push the boundaries of the country genre. And while he refuses to be pigeon-holed, staying grounded in his roots is one thing he insists on. A philanthropist at heart, in 2022 he launched his Annual Big Wheel Charity Golf Classic. The event has raised more than $150,000 to date for community-minded charities. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndhX5RrO9bU"

Among them, he was honored with the Humanitarian Award by the Canadian Country Music Association, the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee Medal, and was also made the first ever Colonel Commandant of the Royal Canadian Air Cadets by the Honourable Peter MacKay, former Minister of National Defense.\nOutside of his music and charitable work, many people might also recognize George for his numerous roles on the big screen. From Charlie Wells in the hit television show Heartland and the head forest ranger in Trailer Park Boys, to Bull Shelton in the Hallmark Channel’s highest-rated original Christmas movie “One Starry Christmas”. George also guest starred on stage in the musical production of Grease in 2018 at the Winter Garden Theatre in Toronto.\nAmong his many identities, Canyon is also a proud Canadian and huge hockey fan, and roots for his team, the Calgary Flames, for which he is in his sixth season singing the national anthem during the home games.\nGeorge released his new memoir on November 8th, 2022 with Simon & Schuster Canada, titled ‘My Country’ – a heartfelt and candid memoir charting his humble beginnings in rural Nova Scotia, the hard-won success he found under the bright lights of Nashville, Tennessee, and the life lessons learned on and off the road that ultimately led him home.\n \nAARON PRITCHETT\nHe’s has been a household name in Canadian Country music for 20 years, but when Aaron Pritchett hits the stage, he does so with the energy and intensity of an artist fresh on the scene. Yet despite being known for his dynamic, even raucous, live shows, it’s the classically country gentleman inside of Pritchett that’s made him a fan favourite – and staying force in Canadian country – for more than two decades.\nWith 13 Top Ten hits under hits under his belt [buckle], Pritchett has made a career of seamlessly moving from good ol’ boy anthems like “Hold My Beer” to pop-tinged party pleasers like “Worth a Shot” to heart-string pulling ballads like “Warm Safe Place”. He could have stopped when he had enough to fill a Greatest Hits album – which he did in 2015 – but instead he followed it up with several more including his 2019 #1 single, “Better When I Do”. Throughout it, Pritchett has racked up more than 30 Juno, CCMA, WCMA and BCCMA nominations including multiple wins for Entertainer of the Year, Male Vocalist of the Year and a CCMA SOCAN Songwriter of the Year award.\nWith his writing, Pritchett continues to push the boundaries of the country genre. And while he refuses to be pigeon-holed, staying grounded in his roots is one thing he insists on.\nA philanthropist at heart, in 2022 he launched his Annual Big Wheel Charity Golf Classic. The event has raised more than $150,000 to date for community-minded charities.\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tPerformer's Website Page\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tA Coast to Coast Cowboy Christmas - Official Website\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tSecond Performer's Website Page\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t - Official Website\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t"

Featuring selections from their brand-new 2025 Christmas compilation, December Coal and their much-loved Christmas in the Mine album. The jolly miners are excited to deliver two uplifting hours of songs and stories, belly laughs and maybe even a step or two. You’ll hear new renditions of old songs, original compositions never heard before and more! Make North America's only coal miners' chorus part of your holiday season. ABOUT THE MEN OF THE DEEPS - est. 1966 For nearly sixty years, Cape Breton’s Men of the Deeps choir have been travelling the world as Canadian Ambassadors, singing and storytelling to give us a sense of what life was life for a miner and his family, in a mining town. Preserving our unique Cape Breton history, folklore, culture and talent. The choir has toured throughout Canada and most of the United States, China and Kosovo. They have been to the Northwest Territories and as far south as Arizona, Alabama, Florida and the Appalachian coal mining communities of Kentucky, Virginia and Pennsylvania. They have even performed in Las Vegas, Nevada. Today, the Men of the Deeps are so much more than just a singing group; they are a social institution. The camaraderie amongst the members carries over to their audiences wherever they perform. Clad in authentic mining coveralls and hard hats, they make an impressive impact when they enter a concert hall in total darkness using only the lamps on their helmets for light. AUDIENCE FEEDBACK “...the most amazing Christmas concert I have ever been to!” - Sandra M.\", Guysborough, N.S. “The men sing with so much passion, making every concert a heartfelt night of song and stories that is so enjoyable!” - Jean &amp; Dennis M., Sydney “Just bought and listened to “Christmas in the Mine” for the first time, it is Fantastic! Thank-you.” - Daniel P. , Wainfleet, Ontario “I have never been to a concert when I was made to feel like it wasn’t a concert. It WAS a Cape Breton kitchen party... Thanks for the trip down home! “ - Deb W., Chatham, Ontario \"I was sitting in the balcony of the theatre with my aunt. We were singing, dancing, I laughed, I cried...I have recommended this show to people and I will most definitely see it again!” - Valerie L., North Bay, Ontario"

Jill’s work has earned her awards, such as the Sirius XM Jazz Artist of the Year and the East Coast Music Award for Album of the Year, and scores of fans, including Blue Rodeo, Ron Sexsmith, and Kris Kristofferson, who called Jill “a real songwriter, and a damn good songwriter.”  Her evocative and timeless songs have been featured in film and TV, scoring shows such as Orange Is The New Black, The L Word, and Heartland, as well as powering a global advertising campaign for Chrysler with the track ‘Never Quit Loving You.’  An unforgettable, enchanting performer, Jill has headlined iconic venues such as Toronto’s Massey Hall and Roy Thompson Hall, Ottawa’s National Arts Centre, Vancouver’s Vogue Theatre and Toykyo’s Blue Note and Cotton Club, and captivating audiences across the globe in Japan, Europe, Australia, Mexico, South America, the USA and the Middle East. "

Other Muppets — Miss Piggy, Gonzo, Fozzie Bear and Sam the Eagle — weave in and out of the story, while Scrooge receives visits from spirits of three Christmases — past, present and future. They show him the error of his self-serving ways, but the miserable old man seems to be past any hope of redemption and happiness.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t"

        "@value": "Payal Kapadia France, India, Netherlands, Luxembourg | 2024 | 118m | Malayalam, Hindi Moving from urban bustle to seaside idyll, this exquisitely beautiful and heartfelt fiction feature debut from Payal Kapadia (A Night of Knowing Nothing) follows two nurses experiencing personal turning points tinged with the possibility of romance. Following her celebrated documentary A Night of Knowing Nothing (TIFF ’21), writer-director Payal Kapadia’s fiction feature debut follows two women at turning points. Moving from urban bustle to seaside idyll, All We Imagine as Light locates dreamlike reverie in emotional shifts and everyday experiences. Prabha (Kani Kusruti) and Anu (Divya Prabha) are roommates and nurses at a Mumbai hospital. Prabha is married, but her husband went abroad to work many years ago. Now drifting into middle age, she focuses on her job. Anu, by contrast, is young and full of dreams for her future, which she hopes will include the handsome Muslim boy she’s secretly seeing. Prabha initially regards the potentially scandalous affair as an annoyance, but she comes to sympathize with Anu’s passion, perhaps because she, too, feels the tug of frustrated ardour, thanks to the attentions of a poetry-writing doctor. When Prabha’s friend Parvaty (Chhaya Kadam) is evicted from her home by heartless developers, she decides to return to the coastal village of her youth. Prabha and Anu tag along for a holiday. Far from the city’s perpetual clamour, the women’s feelings and sense of life’s possibilities are given free rein. Working again with cinematographer Ranabir Das, Kapadia crafts exquisite beauty from images as simple as people wending through a crowded marketplace or women retrieving laundry from a rooftop clothesline. Yet for all the rapturous visuals, nothing in this heartfelt film is more striking than seeing Prabha and Anu forging their connection. Their sisterhood emerges slowly and is all the more moving for its measured pace."

Moving from urban bustle to seaside idyll, All We Imagine as Light locates dreamlike reverie in emotional shifts and everyday experiences.\nPrabha (Kani Kusruti) and Anu (Divya Prabha) are roommates and nurses at a Mumbai hospital. Prabha is married, but her husband went abroad to work many years ago. Now drifting into middle age, she focuses on her job. Anu, by contrast, is young and full of dreams for her future, which she hopes will include the handsome Muslim boy she’s secretly seeing. Prabha initially regards the potentially scandalous affair as an annoyance, but she comes to sympathize with Anu’s passion, perhaps because she, too, feels the tug of frustrated ardour, thanks to the attentions of a poetry-writing doctor.\nWhen Prabha’s friend Parvaty (Chhaya Kadam) is evicted from her home by heartless developers, she decides to return to the coastal village of her youth. Prabha and Anu tag along for a holiday. Far from the city’s perpetual clamour, the women’s feelings and sense of life’s possibilities are given free rein.\nWorking again with cinematographer Ranabir Das, Kapadia crafts exquisite beauty from images as simple as people wending through a crowded marketplace or women retrieving laundry from a rooftop clothesline. Yet for all the rapturous visuals, nothing in this heartfelt film is more striking than seeing Prabha and Anu forging their connection. Their sisterhood emerges slowly and is all the more moving for its measured pace.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t"

In 2014, Sydney Mines, Cape Breton Island-based family group the Barra MacNeils celebrated 27 years of an outstanding recording and touring career. 2012 featured Live In Concert symphony project recorded in Halifax’s Rebecca Cohn Auditorium over two nights with Symphony Nova Scotia and a special Celtic Colours recording project featuring a wide variety of musical guests from the folk, Americana and Celtic music worlds.  In December, 2013, the group released a third Christmas recording: O Christmas Three supported by another run in their annual seasonal Christmas tours. Other recent releases have covered the span of their entire career, as well as live concerts reflecting the musical course of their career, from humble family beginnings to worldwide acclaim. The concert touring in support of these projects has taken the group to theatre and festival stages coast to coast across Canada, had them jetting across America from festival stage to theatre stages and beyond, as well as sending them to Ireland and Scotland for prestigious events across the Atlantic. As a group, the MacNeil siblings are widely regarded as one of the greatest live concert acts in the Celtic world. Hailing from Sydney Mines, Cape Breton Island, Nova Scotia, the family group is deeply rooted in Celtic music, culture, dance, language and history. Their numerous critically acclaimed recordings have included their own original songs as well as tried and true standards, both instrumental and vocal. The Barra MacNeils live concert experience brings so much more to the stage than most live acts ever can. Multiple lead vocalists, beautiful sibling harmonies, top drawer instrumental prowess on a wide variety of acoustic, stringed, percussion and wind instruments blended with dancing, storytelling, Gaelic songs and a journey through an ancient culture; it is family entertainment at its highest level. Steeped in Cape Breton tradition with strong Celtic roots and musical artistry, this diverse and talented family group continues to wow audiences around the world with their captivating vocals, harmonies and extraordinary musicianship. Multi-award winners, the Barra MacNeils have released no less than 17 recordings  including: O Christmas Three (2013), The Celtic Colours Sessions (2012), Live in Concert with Symphony Nova Scotia (2012), In Concert (2009), In Session (2009), 20th Anniversary Collection (2007), Christmas Album II (2006), All At Once (2005), Racket In the Attic (2002), Christmas Album (1999), Until Now (1997), The Question(1995), The Traditional Album (1994), Closer to Paradise (1993 – Certified Gold in Canada), Timeframe (1990), Rock in the Stream (1989), The Barra MacNeils (1986). In 2001, they released a DVD titled Cape Breton Christmas incorporating music from their live Christmas Concert Special (as seen on television), plus a visit to Cape Breton, interviews with the Barra MacNeils home at Christmas and music videos. Canada’s Celtic ambassadors, the Barra MacNeils continue to perform to sold out audiences throughout Canada, the United States, the Caribbean, the United Kingdom and Europe. From headlining major festivals, concerts, special guest appearances (Rita MacNeils CTV Christmas Special, performing with The Chieftains) television specials, film and television placement (Men with Brooms Soundtrack; Racket In The Attic) and their annual Christmas tour, they have set the course with a solid foundation for success. The Barra MacNeils one-hour Christmas Television Special (2000) continues to be broadcast on Country Music Television (CMT) and on the Public Broadcasting Services (PBS) network in the United States. December 2007 saw the broadcast of a new Christmas Special which will no doubt also become part of the holiday season for years to come. The Barra MacNeils continues to do what they love to do best, and that is playing their music for the fans. This incredibly talented family group tours Canada, the US and Europe to spread their distinctive brand of Celtic music worldwide. [embed]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y70T54pJ35o[/embed]"

        "@value": "“The Maritimes’ most promising young MC” - Complex “one of this country's most promising young rappers” - CBC Music — Wolf Castle is an Indigenous Mi’kmaq rapper, producer, and singer from Pabineau First Nation, New Brunswick - an unlikely place for a rap career to come to fruition but everything about Wolf Castle defies the odds. Growing up on the reserve with a supportive family of artists, movie directors and musicians, going for a career in the arts seemed like the natural choice.

His path led him to the Pickle Family Circus in San Francisco and later to Cirque Éloize in Montréal (Québec). There, he created his first show TYPO, which received international acclaim from critics and audiences alike. In 2007 Jamie created his second solo show Circus Incognitus and performed over 1200 performances in 27 countries. Jamie has travelled with his show in the Americas, Europe, Australia and China. He has participated in many festivals in Hong Kong, Beijing, Shanghai, Macau, Mexico, Italy, New Caledonia and Bermuda. Hundreds of performances were given throughout Canada and the United States. Jamie Adkins is a performer in the vaudeville tradition of Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton. With no hi-tech distractions, his irresistible character heroically battles with the everyday objects of life, permanently on the verge of disaster… moving but hilarious. Everywhere he goes, the public, adults and children alike, laugh out loud at the humour and marvel at the multi-talented performance of Jamie in Circus Incognitus. An unforgettable one-man circus comedy! Come along for the journey as things go awry for his character when he encounters unhelpful props while attempting to present a new show that he proudly created for the audience. His ladder falls apart under foot, he wrangles a chair, he negotiates a precarious slack wire, and juggles everything! An eclectic clown, juggler, balancing artist, and multidisciplinary acrobat, Adkins has performed Circus Incognitus more than 1,200 times in 27 countries. This international hit is hilarious, poetic, and elegantly simple. Adkins’ exceptional circus skills and refreshing performance style are a throwback to the great clowns of silent film and the golden age of cartoons, and are guaranteed to make you laugh and gasp while cheering him on.

These comedy powerhouses come together for the first time since their early days at The Second City to deliver a delightfully absurd and wildly entertaining variety show. Presenting a little bit of what made This is That and Baroness von Sketch so special, your algorithm has no business being in the theatre during this evening when these seasoned comedians launch into their exceedingly reasonable evening of comedy. Don’t miss this rare and hysterical reunion. CAROLYN TAYLOR Carolyn Taylor is a whip-smart comedian, writer, and actor known for her fearless satire and bold sense of humor. As a co-creator and star of the hit show The Baroness von Sketch Show (CBC) and creator of I Have Nothing (Crave), she’s won fans and accolades with her unique blend of sharp social commentary and character-driven sketches. Carlolyn’s comedy is unapologetically original and relentlessly funny. She is incredibly excited to be teaming up with Peter Oldring and Pat Kelly to present an unforgettable evening. PAT KELLY Pat Kelly is a creative powerhouse and co-creator of CBC’s acclaimed satirical show This is That. Known for his sharp wit and knack for finding humor in the everyday absurd, Pat has carved a unique space in comedy, blending smart storytelling with biting satire. Whether behind the mic or crafting unforgettable sketches, he’s a master at keeping audiences entertained and on their toes. PETER OLDRING Peter Oldring is a comedian, actor, and improviser celebrated for his chameleon-like ability to inhabit ridiculous characters. From his award-winning work on CBC’s This Is That to standout performances in film and TV, Peter has charmed audiences from coast to coast for over 30 years. Always unpredictable and endlessly funny, Peter brings an unparalleled energy to every performance."

A domestic worker by day, Kwazibani was a “Sangoma” or “African medicine woman” with a natural gift for music. Nomfusi would accompany her mother to weekly Sangoma rituals known as “Intlombe,” where she soon developed a love for performing and crafted her artistic identity by dancing and singing for hours.

Undeterred by the hand she was dealt at such a young age, Nomfusi turned her situation around to become one of South Africa's brightest, most recognizable stars. Never one for self-pity, Nomfusi strives to inspire others with her worldview that “life is about choices” and that \"one has to overcome the poverty of the mind first.” Her compassion has led her to doing outreach work at schools for at-risk youth in Soweto, Swaziland, and Malawi, and creating opportunities she didn’t have for the next generation.

Disguised as men, Irish swashbuckler Anne Bonny and English privateer-turned-pirate Mary Read looted, plundered and outfought many of their male counterparts throughout the Caribbean before being captured and sentenced to hang. Clashing sword fights, brutal wrestling matches and sharp-as-a-blade humour bring these historical figures to the stage to explore what a life well lived truly is.\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tPerformer's Website Page\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tTheatre New Brunswick: Heroine - Official Website\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t"

Tom is often called the godfather of the podcasting revolution, who inspired a generation of voices to find their platform.\n\n\nTom Green VIP Meet & Greet Add-On\n$62.50 // The VIP Meet & Greet will take place after the performance.

A tribute to the dedication required to realise our physical ambitions. An acknowledgement of the backstory that is often more spectacular than the finished product. Eight world class acrobats investigate physical skill; how we obtain it, how we perfect it, and how it can transform our lives. Through highlighting the nuance of high-level acrobatics, audiences experience a heightened appreciation of the countless hours required to master the skills they are witnessing. This is a love letter to our bodies and the amazing things they let us do every day. This is an invitation to watch us work.

When the dinosaur wanders away from home, he discovers a wonderful world full of creatures that light up the darkness and help him find the true meaning of love.

        "@value": "A Fun, Appealing Story William Shakespeare’s A Midsummer Night’s Dream is one of his most beloved comedies. Four Athenians find themselves in a forest inhabited by fairies who manipulate the humans and are engaged in their own domestic intrigue. It is a lighthearted, humourous and fun tale of love and, often misguided, magic set in motion by the mischievous trickster Puck. The ballet adaptation is set to Mendelssohn’s 1827 concert overture and 1843 instrumental score which includes the famous “Wedding March.” Ballet: A Canadian Way Bengt Jörgen will bring this story to life in his own original ballet version as a tribute to Canada’s North. Ballet Jörgen’s A Midsummer Night’s Dream will bring out the magic of Northern Canada’s woodland and tundra landscapes and creatures of the forest such as moose, beavers, bears, and squirrels. In addition to our professional dancers, each performance will include up to 10 age-appropriate roles for local young aspiring dancers, ages 9 to 17, through Ballet Jörgen's Local Participant Program. Built for our Audience and Communities This family-friendly short ballet will captivate audiences of all ages and will warm the hearts of young and old alike. CHOREOGRAPHER Bengt Jörgen C.M.

Four Athenians\nfind themselves in a forest inhabited by fairies who manipulate the humans and are engaged in their own\ndomestic intrigue. It is a lighthearted, humourous and fun tale of love and, often misguided, magic set in\nmotion by the mischievous trickster Puck. The ballet adaptation is set to Mendelssohn’s 1827 concert\noverture and 1843 instrumental score which includes the famous “Wedding March.”\nBallet: A Canadian Way\nBengt Jörgen will bring this story to life in his own original ballet version as a tribute to Canada’s North.\nBallet Jörgen’s A Midsummer Night’s Dream will bring out the magic of Northern Canada’s woodland and\ntundra landscapes and creatures of the forest such as moose, beavers, bears, and squirrels. In addition to\nour professional dancers, each performance will include up to 10 age-appropriate roles for local young\naspiring dancers, ages 9 to 17, through Ballet Jörgen’s Local Participant Program.\nBuilt for our Audience and Communities\nThis family-friendly short ballet will captivate audiences of all ages and will warm the hearts of young and\nold alike.\nCHOREOGRAPHER Bengt Jörgen C.M.\nMUSIC Felix Mendelssohn\nSET & COSTUME DESIGN Sue LePage\nLIGHTING DESIGN Madhu Seran\nSTAGE DIRECTION & DRAMA COACH Heinar Piller\n1 hour & 40 minutes w 1 intermission\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tPerformer's Website Page\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBallet Jörgen: Mid Summer Night’s Dream - Official Website\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t"

        "@value": "Kalabanté Productions was created by Yamoussa Bangoura, a multidisciplinary artist of Guinean origin.  Yamoussa’s long term dream was the founding of a school of circus arts, and direct his own multidisciplinary company specializing in the African arts.  As the company director he develops his own shows which over the past several years have been increasingly gathering attention and recognition in the Quebec circus arts community and worldwide.  Kô Ryass, and other shows such as Kumbaya, Uno, Kira Nene and Afrique en Cirque have been created and performed worldwide.  Several new projects are in development for the coming years, which will continue to disseminate and promote the values of the company. Yamoussa first became interested in the Circus Arts as a young man growing up in Conakry Guinea in the 1990’s.   He studied the circus performers he saw on European TV and practiced on the beach and dirt around his home. He also studied the Nyamakala tradition of circus, practiced by the Fula people of West Africa. He eventually joined Guinea’s original circus company, Circus Baobob. with whom he toured Africa and Europe.  With this company he was able to spend time in Spain and France where he honed many of the European style circus skills. In the early 2000’s, he was recruited to come to Canada with Cirque Eloize, a Montreal based Canadian cirque company.  [embed]https://youtu.be/7jmTvOG4jJI[/embed]"

With Cameron sinkʷə Fraser-Monroe’s compelling taqəš, Alysa Pires’ striking Vestiges, and Guillaume Côté’s electrifying Le Carnaval des Animaux, this high-energy program from Canada’s leading dancemakers promises to please a wide range of spectators. Cameron sinkʷə Fraser-Monroe brings his classical ballet training, knowledge of traditional Coast Salish, Grass, and Hoop Dance, and experience as a contemporary dancer to taqəš [tawKESH], which means “to return something” in Ayajuthem, the language belonging to the Homalco, Klahoose, K’omoks, and Tla’amin Nations. Set to several songs by Polaris Prize-winning composer and singer Jeremy Dutcher, taqəš follows the traditional story “Raven Returns the Water,” centred around ῤoho (raven) and walθ (frog).  Next, award-winning choreographer Alysa Pires constructs a striking commentary on the search for true connection and meaning amid disorder. Set to the cinematic melodies of violinist Hilary Hahn and composer Hauschka, Vestiges highlights the virtuosity of Pires’ bold and lively choreography. Rounding out the program, Guillaume Côté, recently retired Principal Dancer and Chorographic Associate with The National Ballet of Canada, applies his fresh, artistic vision to a jovial rendition of Camille Saint-Saëns’ Le Carnaval des Animaux, regarded as one of the French composer’s best-known works. Full of whimsical ornamentation, this upbeat ensemble piece pushes the limits of contemporary ballet and promises to delight audiences with its exuberant energy of frolicking and fun. taqəš Choreography: Cameron sinkʷə Fraser-Monroe Music: Jeremy Dutcher, Oqiton, Essuwonike, Ultestakon | Wolastoqiyik Lintuwakonawa Lighting Design: Rylee Block after James Proudfoot Costume Concept: Cameron sinkʷə Fraser-Monroe Dancers: TBD Pause &nbsp; Vestiges Choreography: Alysa Pires Music: Hilary Hahn and Hauschka Lighting Design: Rylee Block Costume Concept: Alysa Pires Costume Couturier: Colleen Bryant | KOCO Dancers: TBD Intermission &nbsp; Le Carnaval des Animaux Choreography: Guillaume Côté Music: Camille Saint-Saëns, Le Carnaval des animaux Lighting Design: Rylee Block Costumes: TBD Dancers: TBD &nbsp; CAMERON sinkʷə FRASER-MONROE | Choreographer, taqəš Cameron sinkʷə Fraser-Monroe is a member of the Tla’amin First Nation. At three years old he started Ukrainian dancing in Vernon, BC. He was privileged to receive several years of training and performance with World Champion hoop dancer Dallas Arcand and studied grass dance with Elder Mollie Bono. Since graduating from the Royal Winnipeg Ballet School on the RWB Alumni Scholarship, he has performed with many companies including Dancers of Damelahamid at Kia Mau Festival in New Zealand and the International Cervantino Festival, Jera Wolfe at Jacob’s Pillow Festival, Canada’s Royal Winnipeg Ballet at the National Arts Centre, the Atlantic Ballet Theatre of Canada, and Ballet Kelowna.  As a choreographer, Mr. Fraser-Monroe has received commissions from The National Ballet of Canada, Canada’s Royal Winnipeg Ballet, Fall for Dance Festival in NYC, Ballet Kelowna, the Winnipeg Summer Dance Collective, Whim W’Him Seattle, the Museum of Contemporary Art Toronto, Artist’s Climate Collective, Transformation Cabaret at the Cultch, and both PULSE and Indigenous Day Live! on APTN. He continues to practice and present hoop dance. &nbsp; ALYSA PIRES | Choreographer, MAMBO Alysa Pires was born and raised on the traditional territory of the W̱SÁNEĆ people near Victoria, BC. She is an Honours BFA graduate of Toronto Metropolitan University and her choreographic works have been performed by companies such as The National Ballet of Canada, Alberta Ballet, Ballet Kelowna, Canada’s Ballet Jörgen, and Ballet Edmonton. Ms. Pires began working with the National Ballet of Canada as part of their Choreographic Workshop (2016-2018) where she created her critically acclaimed work In Between. She represented the company at the 13th International Competition for the Erik Bruhn Prize and was then appointed Choreographic Associate by Karen Kain, a position Ms. Pires held from 2019-2022. Ms. Pires recently became the first Canadian woman to create a work for New York City Ballet, making her Lincoln Center debut in May 2023 with Standard Deviation.  &nbsp; GUILLAUME CÔTÉ | Choreographer, Le Carnaval des Animaux Guillaume Côté studied at Canada’s National Ballet School and joined The National Ballet of Canada in 1998. He quickly rose through the ranks and was promoted to Principal Dancer in 2004. In 2013, in addition to his position as a Principal Dancer, Mr. Côté assumed the role of Choreographic Associate with The National Ballet of Canada. Since then, eight of his pieces have entered the Company’s repertoire including, most recently, Being and Nothingness performed on an international tour to Russia. His first full-length ballet Le Petit Prince was presented by The National Ballet to sold-out houses in 2016. In 2018, Mr. Côté created in collaboration with the famed Director Robert Lepage, Frame by Frame, a new full-length evening. Mr. Côté is also the Artistic Director of the Festival des Arts de Saint-Sauveur, one of the largest summer dance festivals in the country."

With Cameron sinkʷə Fraser-Monroe’s compelling taqəš, Alysa Pires’ striking Vestiges, and Guillaume Côté’s electrifying Le Carnaval des Animaux, this high-energy program from Canada’s leading dancemakers promises to please a wide range of spectators.\nCameron sinkʷə Fraser-Monroe brings his classical ballet training, knowledge of traditional Coast Salish, Grass, and Hoop Dance, and experience as a contemporary dancer to taqəš [tawKESH], which means “to return something” in Ayajuthem, the language belonging to the Homalco, Klahoose, K’omoks, and Tla’amin Nations. Set to several songs by Polaris Prize-winning composer and singer Jeremy Dutcher, taqəš follows the traditional story “Raven Returns the Water,” centred around ῤoho (raven) and walθ (frog). \nNext, award-winning choreographer Alysa Pires constructs a striking commentary on the search for true connection and meaning amid disorder. Set to the cinematic melodies of violinist Hilary Hahn and composer Hauschka, Vestiges highlights the virtuosity of Pires’ bold and lively choreography.\nRounding out the program, Guillaume Côté, recently retired Principal Dancer and Chorographic Associate with The National Ballet of Canada, applies his fresh, artistic vision to a jovial rendition of Camille Saint-Saëns’ Le Carnaval des Animaux, regarded as one of the French composer’s best-known works. Full of whimsical ornamentation, this upbeat ensemble piece pushes the limits of contemporary ballet and promises to delight audiences with its exuberant energy of frolicking and fun.\ntaqəš\nChoreography: Cameron sinkʷə Fraser-Monroe\nMusic: Jeremy Dutcher, Oqiton, Essuwonike, Ultestakon | Wolastoqiyik Lintuwakonawa\nLighting Design: Rylee Block after James Proudfoot\nCostume Concept: Cameron sinkʷə Fraser-Monroe\nDancers: TBD\n\nPause\n \nVestiges\nChoreography: Alysa Pires\nMusic: Hilary Hahn and Hauschka\nLighting Design: Rylee Block\nCostume Concept: Alysa Pires\nCostume Couturier: Colleen Bryant | KOCO\nDancers: TBD\n\nIntermission\n \nLe Carnaval des Animaux\nChoreography: Guillaume Côté\nMusic: Camille Saint-Saëns, Le Carnaval des animaux\nLighting Design: Rylee Block\nCostumes: TBD\nDancers: TBD\n \nCAMERON sinkʷə FRASER-MONROE | Choreographer, taqəš \n\nCameron sinkʷə Fraser-Monroe is a member of the Tla’amin First Nation. At three years old he started Ukrainian dancing in Vernon, BC. He was privileged to receive several years of training and performance with World Champion hoop dancer Dallas Arcand and studied grass dance with Elder Mollie Bono. Since graduating from the Royal Winnipeg Ballet School on the RWB Alumni Scholarship, he has performed with many companies including Dancers of Damelahamid at Kia Mau Festival in New Zealand and the International Cervantino Festival, Jera Wolfe at Jacob’s Pillow Festival, Canada’s Royal Winnipeg Ballet at the National Arts Centre, the Atlantic Ballet Theatre of Canada, and Ballet Kelowna. \nAs a choreographer, Mr. Fraser-Monroe has received commissions from The National Ballet of Canada, Canada’s Royal Winnipeg Ballet, Fall for Dance Festival in NYC, Ballet Kelowna, the Winnipeg Summer Dance Collective, Whim W’Him Seattle, the Museum of Contemporary Art Toronto, Artist’s Climate Collective, Transformation Cabaret at the Cultch, and both PULSE and Indigenous Day Live! on APTN. He continues to practice and present hoop dance.\n \nALYSA PIRES | Choreographer, MAMBO\n\nAlysa Pires was born and raised on the traditional territory of the W̱SÁNEĆ people near Victoria, BC. She is an Honours BFA graduate of Toronto Metropolitan University and her choreographic works have been performed by companies such as The National Ballet of Canada, Alberta Ballet, Ballet Kelowna, Canada’s Ballet Jörgen, and Ballet Edmonton. Ms. Pires began working with the National Ballet of Canada as part of their Choreographic Workshop (2016-2018) where she created her critically acclaimed work In Between. She represented the company at the 13th International Competition for the Erik Bruhn Prize and was then appointed Choreographic Associate by Karen Kain, a position Ms. Pires held from 2019-2022. Ms. Pires recently became the first Canadian woman to create a work for New York City Ballet, making her Lincoln Center debut in May 2023 with Standard Deviation. \n \nGUILLAUME CÔTÉ | Choreographer, Le Carnaval des Animaux\n\nGuillaume Côté studied at Canada’s National Ballet School and joined The National Ballet of Canada in 1998. He quickly rose through the ranks and was promoted to Principal Dancer in 2004. In 2013, in addition to his position as a Principal Dancer, Mr. Côté assumed the role of Choreographic Associate with The National Ballet of Canada. Since then, eight of his pieces have entered the Company’s repertoire including, most recently, Being and Nothingness performed on an international tour to Russia. His first full-length ballet Le Petit Prince was presented by The National Ballet to sold-out houses in 2016. In 2018, Mr. Côté created in collaboration with the famed Director Robert Lepage, Frame by Frame, a new full-length evening. Mr. Côté is also the Artistic Director of the Festival des Arts de Saint-Sauveur, one of the largest summer dance festivals in the country. \n\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tPerformer's Website Page\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBallet Kelowna: taqəš and Other Works - Official Website\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t"
