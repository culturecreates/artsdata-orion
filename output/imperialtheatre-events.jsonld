Sarah will offer a short introduction to this marvellous and intense piece before playing the full work.\r\n\r\n\"Canadian pianist Sarah Hagen’s Goldberg Variations are dramatically different. Naysayers and refusniks beware: her approach combines unfettered joy, wide awake with wonder, requisite pedagogy, and the ability to make the instrument bend to her will. The epic scope of the work is stated right out of the gate, with an extensive exploration of the Aria that opens the way to the variable tempi, harmonic adventure with unlimited changes in registration and emotion.

Awarded as Artist of the Year\r\nby both Ontario Contact (2017) and the BC Touring Council (2015), and mentioned by The Guardian\r\n(Charlottetown) as the Best Classical Performance of 2014, her interpretations have been described\r\nas \"outstandingly inventive\" [University of Waterloo Gazette], ”played flawlessly” [ReviewVancouver].\r\n\r\nA visionary and an idealist, Sarah's performances are conceptually innovative, involving photogra-\r\nphy, dance, and theatre. She is Artistic Director for Pro'ject Sound, a performance project involving\r\n\r\nlive piano with large-scale projected images.\r\nAn avid collaborator, Sarah has performed with cellist Ariel Barnes, violist Nicolò Eugelmi, cellist\r\nPhillip Hansen, violinist Robert Uchida, tenor Benjamin Butterfield, horn player Oto Carrillo, soprano\r\nBarbara Livingston, Trio Accord, Ballet Victoria, the Emily Carr String Quartet, the Bergmann Piano\r\nDuo, jazz pianist Søren Bebe, clarinettist Keith MacLeod, among many others. Sarah has appeared\r\nas soloist with the Victoria Symphony under the baton of Mei-Ann Chen, the Kitchener-Waterloo\r\nSymphony conducted by Mark Skazinetsky, the West Coast Symphony Orchestra with conductor\r\nBujar Llapaj, and the Symphony Orchestra of the Pacific with conductor Arthur Arnold.\r\nAs a First Prize Winner in the 2013 Bradshaw &amp; Buono International Piano Competition, Sarah was\r\n\r\nawarded the opportunity to perform solo at New York City’s Carnegie Hall in May 2013. Sarah re-\r\nleased an album of Goldberg Variations in 2021. Her third album, Women of Note, highlights two for-\r\ngotten female composers of the 18th century, and garnered the 2021 Music PEI Instrumental\r\n\r\nRecording of the Year as well as two ECMA nominations. Sarah’s debut solo album, Glass House\r\nDancing, was nominated for Classical Recording of the Year at the 2009 Western Canadian Music\r\nAwards. Her second album, Devoted: Music of Robert &amp; Clara Schumann, features solo piano works\r\nand Clara Schumann’s Romances, Opus 22 with violinist Martin Chalifour, concertmaster of the Los\r\nAngeles Philharmonic.\r\nSarah has been been heard nationally on CBC Radio 2’s In Concert in a live recording with violinist\r\nJoan Blackman and cellist Ariel Barnes. She was also featured in a live recording and discussion of\r\n\r\nSchumann’s Papillons on CBC Radio One’s North by Northwest with host Sheryl MacKay. In Hels-\r\ningborg, Sweden in 2006 she recorded with Swedish cellist Marit Sjödin, creating Concealed Dia-\r\nmonds, an album of masterworks for cello and piano.\r\n\r\nSarah’s primary teachers and mentors have been Jamie Parker, Gregory Chaverdian, Christine\r\nPurvis and Glen Montgomery. She has completed five residencies at the Banff Centre for the Arts\r\nand enjoyed two terms there as collaborative pianist.\r\nDuring her years on the west coast of Canada, Sarah founded nine concert series, curating each\r\none individually, and inviting artists from across Canada and around the world to share the stage\r\nwith her. She has toured throughout Sweden numerous times with cellist Marit Sjödin, violinist Ian\r\n\r\nPeaston, and Per Johansson, principal clarinet of the Helsingborg Symphony Orchestra. Other in-\r\nternational concerts of note include a recital at DePaul University with Oto Carrillo, hornist in the\r\n\r\nChicago Symphony, Schumann Piano Quintet in Darmstadt with members of the Frankfurt Radio\r\nSymphony, and a performance at Carnegie Hall with Polish flautist Krzysztof Kaczka.\r\nIn addition to writing wine reviews for her blog, “ARTIST WINES! - Uncorking musician-priced cellar\r\nsecrets,” Sarah tours a one-woman musical comedy show called “Perk up, pianist!” of which the\r\nEdmonton Journal wrote, “Her comic timing is as solid as her musical meter.”"

Sarah will offer a short introduction to this marvellous and intense piece before playing the full work.\n“Canadian pianist Sarah Hagen’s Goldberg Variations are dramatically different. Naysayers and refusniks beware: her approach combines unfettered joy, wide awake with wonder, requisite pedagogy, and the ability to make the instrument bend to her will. The epic scope of the work is stated right out of the gate, with an extensive exploration of the Aria that opens the way to the variable tempi, harmonic adventure with unlimited changes in registration and emotion. Hagen’s performance combines vivid precision of touch with perfect articulation of line, making her Goldberg Variations something to absolutely die for.”        – Whole Note Magazine\n† Programme ¢\nPrelude Johann Gottlieb Goldberg (1727-1756)\nGoldberg Variations Johann Sebastian Bach (1685-1750)\nAria\nVariatio 1 a 1 Clav.\nVariatio 2 a 1 Clav.\nVariatio 3 Canone all’Unisono a 1 Clav.\nVariatio 4 a 1 Clav.\nVariatio 5 a 1 ovvero 2 Clav.\nVariatio 6 Canone alla Seconda a 1 Clav.\nVariatio 7 a 1 ovvero 2 Clav.

Awarded as Artist of the Year\nby both Ontario Contact (2017) and the BC Touring Council (2015), and mentioned by The Guardian\n(Charlottetown) as the Best Classical Performance of 2014, her interpretations have been described\nas “outstandingly inventive” [University of Waterloo Gazette], ”played flawlessly” [ReviewVancouver].\nA visionary and an idealist, Sarah’s performances are conceptually innovative, involving photogra-\nphy, dance, and theatre. She is Artistic Director for Pro’ject Sound, a performance project involving\nlive piano with large-scale projected images.\nAn avid collaborator, Sarah has performed with cellist Ariel Barnes, violist Nicolò Eugelmi, cellist\nPhillip Hansen, violinist Robert Uchida, tenor Benjamin Butterfield, horn player Oto Carrillo, soprano\nBarbara Livingston, Trio Accord, Ballet Victoria, the Emily Carr String Quartet, the Bergmann Piano\nDuo, jazz pianist Søren Bebe, clarinettist Keith MacLeod, among many others. Sarah has appeared\nas soloist with the Victoria Symphony under the baton of Mei-Ann Chen, the Kitchener-Waterloo\nSymphony conducted by Mark Skazinetsky, the West Coast Symphony Orchestra with conductor\nBujar Llapaj, and the Symphony Orchestra of the Pacific with conductor Arthur Arnold.\nAs a First Prize Winner in the 2013 Bradshaw & Buono International Piano Competition, Sarah was\nawarded the opportunity to perform solo at New York City’s Carnegie Hall in May 2013. Sarah re-\nleased an album of Goldberg Variations in 2021. Her third album, Women of Note, highlights two for-\ngotten female composers of the 18th century, and garnered the 2021 Music PEI Instrumental\nRecording of the Year as well as two ECMA nominations. Sarah’s debut solo album, Glass House\nDancing, was nominated for Classical Recording of the Year at the 2009 Western Canadian Music\nAwards. Her second album, Devoted: Music of Robert & Clara Schumann, features solo piano works\nand Clara Schumann’s Romances, Opus 22 with violinist Martin Chalifour, concertmaster of the Los\nAngeles Philharmonic.\nSarah has been been heard nationally on CBC Radio 2’s In Concert in a live recording with violinist\nJoan Blackman and cellist Ariel Barnes. She was also featured in a live recording and discussion of\nSchumann’s Papillons on CBC Radio One’s North by Northwest with host Sheryl MacKay. In Hels-\ningborg, Sweden in 2006 she recorded with Swedish cellist Marit Sjödin, creating Concealed Dia-\nmonds, an album of masterworks for cello and piano.\nSarah’s primary teachers and mentors have been Jamie Parker, Gregory Chaverdian, Christine\nPurvis and Glen Montgomery. She has completed five residencies at the Banff Centre for the Arts\nand enjoyed two terms there as collaborative pianist.\nDuring her years on the west coast of Canada, Sarah founded nine concert series, curating each\none individually, and inviting artists from across Canada and around the world to share the stage\nwith her. She has toured throughout Sweden numerous times with cellist Marit Sjödin, violinist Ian\nPeaston, and Per Johansson, principal clarinet of the Helsingborg Symphony Orchestra. Other in-\nternational concerts of note include a recital at DePaul University with Oto Carrillo, hornist in the\nChicago Symphony, Schumann Piano Quintet in Darmstadt with members of the Frankfurt Radio\nSymphony, and a performance at Carnegie Hall with Polish flautist Krzysztof Kaczka.\nIn addition to writing wine reviews for her blog, “ARTIST WINES! – Uncorking musician-priced cellar\nsecrets,” Sarah tours a one-woman musical comedy show called “Perk up, pianist!” of which the\nEdmonton Journal wrote, “Her comic timing is as solid as her musical meter.”\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tPerformer's Website Page\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSarah Hagen - Official Website\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tPerformer's Facebook Page\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSarah Hagen on Facebook\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t"

George, an Irish Rover all his life, wrote the song, “Hey Boys Sing Us A Song” as a response to the Covid years, and includes the refrain “We all need some happiness back in our lives!” The song is nominated Canadian Folk Music Awards, SINGLE OF THE YEAR. \r\n\r\nOn their 60th Anniversary, ‘Dinosaurs’ of the Canadian Music scene are up for a 2023 Canadian Folk Music Award and now on their sold out NO END IN SIGHT Tour Canadian music veterans, The Irish Rovers continue to entertain and gain generations of fans, into their 60th year, with their upcoming (nearly sold out) tour (30 concerts). Last year the legendary band hit Spotify’s VIRAL TOP 50 in both the US and UK/ Ireland, and recorded a new album, No End In Sight.  They have included their original 1977 version of “The Wellerman\" on the new album (with an updated ending).\r\n\r\nThe No End In Sight album includes a new anthem for our time, Hey Boys Sing Us A Song - nominated SINGLE OF THE YEAR in the 2023 Canadian Folk Music Awards. The song, written by Rovers leader and co-founder, George Millar was inspired by the last few years of frustrations and includes the welcome refrain, “We all need some happiness back in our lives!\" \r\n\r\nVideo, Hey Boys Sing Us A Song: https://youtu.be/vHH5-W3-FTA\r\n\r\nSpotify: https://open.spotify.com/track/4LZu5lzxBwfi6BpNdZ2TsE   Apple Music: https://music.apple.com/us/album/hey-boys-sing-us-a-song/1600027792\r\n\r\n NOTE: The Rovers refer to themselves and other music veterans as Dinosaurs on the last song of their new \"No End in Sight” album. A tribute to the old crusty musicians who have paid their dues and are still going strong today in an environment that is hostile to their survival.  https://open.spotify.com/track/7KPGaVjsXEsmqSF7GrMHTR?si=f716486ed2d3449d\r\n\r\nFans should fasten their seatbelts for a rollicking night of the hits, Rovers latest, and hilarious stories from decades of Rovin.' On stage in 2023 will be George Millar, Ian Millar, Davey Walker (keyboards), Gerry O’Connor (fiddle), Geoffrey Kelly (flute/whistle), Fred Graham (bodhran), and joining the Rovers for the first time will be virtuosos Shane Farrell on banjo, Jimmy Keane on accordion and Kevin Evans from Evans and Doherty. Some may remember Kevin from his days singing with the Clancy Brothers.\r\n\r\nCanada has been home to the Irish Rovers since its inception in the early 60s. Millar says, “It’s been a bit odd, being from both Ireland and Canada.

George, an Irish Rover all his life, wrote the song, “Hey Boys Sing Us A Song” as a response to the Covid years, and includes the refrain “We all need some happiness back in our lives!” The song is nominated Canadian Folk Music Awards, SINGLE OF THE YEAR. \nOn their 60th Anniversary, ‘Dinosaurs’ of the Canadian Music scene are up for a 2023 Canadian Folk Music Award and now on their sold out NO END IN SIGHT Tour Canadian music veterans, The Irish Rovers continue to entertain and gain generations of fans, into their 60th year, with their upcoming (nearly sold out) tour (30 concerts). Last year the legendary band hit Spotify’s VIRAL TOP 50 in both the US and UK/ Ireland, and recorded a new album, No End In Sight.  They have included their original 1977 version of “The Wellerman” on the new album (with an updated ending).\nThe No End In Sight album includes a new anthem for our time, Hey Boys Sing Us A Song – nominated SINGLE OF THE YEAR in the 2023 Canadian Folk Music Awards. The song, written by Rovers leader and co-founder, George Millar was inspired by the last few years of frustrations and includes the welcome refrain, “We all need some happiness back in our lives!” \nVideo, Hey Boys Sing Us A Song: https://youtu.be/vHH5-W3-FTA\nSpotify: https://open.spotify.com/track/4LZu5lzxBwfi6BpNdZ2TsE   Apple Music: https://music.apple.com/us/album/hey-boys-sing-us-a-song/1600027792\n NOTE: The Rovers refer to themselves and other music veterans as Dinosaurs on the last song of their new “No End in Sight” album. A tribute to the old crusty musicians who have paid their dues and are still going strong today in an environment that is hostile to their survival.  https://open.spotify.com/track/7KPGaVjsXEsmqSF7GrMHTR?si=f716486ed2d3449d\nFans should fasten their seatbelts for a rollicking night of the hits, Rovers latest, and hilarious stories from decades of Rovin.’ On stage in 2023 will be George Millar, Ian Millar, Davey Walker (keyboards), Gerry O’Connor (fiddle), Geoffrey Kelly (flute/whistle), Fred Graham (bodhran), and joining the Rovers for the first time will be virtuosos Shane Farrell on banjo, Jimmy Keane on accordion and Kevin Evans from Evans and Doherty. Some may remember Kevin from his days singing with the Clancy Brothers.\nCanada has been home to the Irish Rovers since its inception in the early 60s. Millar says, “It’s been a bit odd, being from both Ireland and Canada. The fans have found it confusing as well.” This lead to the song “Band Without A Country” from the Rovers’ 2020 album “Saints And Sinners”.

        "@value": "The title of William Shakespeare’s As You Like It holds a double meaning that teasingly suggests this is a play to please all tastes. Is that possible? \r\n\r\nCalled “sly, funny, and charming” by the Toronto Star, As You Like It Or The Land Acknowledgement by cultural provocateur Cliff Cardinal, is a devastating yet laugh-out-loud examination of land acknowledgements as cultural and political practice. A timeless tale of mistaken identities, banishment, and forgiveness takes on an entirely new meaning in this subversive update of the Bard’s classic. Cardinal’s Cree and Lakota heritage deeply inform his take on the play, which is acerbic, mischievous, and fearlessly deals with difficult subject matter.\r\n\r\n“The Canadian arts surprise of the year” (The Globe and Mai), William Shakespeare’s As You Like It, A Radical Retelling by Cliff Cardinal was the recipient the prestigious Governor General’s Literary Award for Drama and was shortlisted for the Ontario Trillium Book Award.\r\n\r\n“One thing’s certain: this As You Like It is unlike any other production of the play, past or future.”   NOW Magazine\r\n\r\nAges 14+\r\n\r\nCliff Cardinal – Creator and Writer\r\nNamed by The Globe and Mail as a Canadian Cultural Icon in 2022, Cliff Cardinal is a polarizing writer and performer known for his black humour and compassionate poeticism. His AS YOU LIKE IT, A RADICAL RETELLING has been performed across Canada, was shortlisted for the Ontario Trillium Book Award, and was the recipient of the prestigious Governor General’s Literary Award for Drama. Other solo theatre productions including Stitch, Huff, Cliff Cardinal’s CBC Special, and (Everyone I Love Has) A Terrible Fate (Befall Them) have toured across Canada and won numerous awards. He is an associate artist at VideoCabaret where he develops his new work. Born on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation, he studied\r\nplaywriting at the National Theatre School of Canada and fronts the hilarious and nefarious Cliff Cardinal and The Skylarks.\r\n\r\nCardinal’s first multi-character play, Too Good To Be True, opened VideoCabaret’s 2019 season at The Busy Street Theatre in Toronto with Cardinal himself directing. A workshop version of the script debuted at Summerworks ’13, where NOW Magazine said, “This captivating tale of an off-grid mother and her desperate children solidifies Cardinal as one of the most talented and intriguing writers in the country.” Prior to premiering AS YOU LIKE IT, A RADICAL RETELLING, Cardinal was best known for his one-man play Huff, which he has performed over 200 times. This harrowing yet hilarious show about youth who abuse solvent, at high risk of suicide won the Buddies in Bad Times’ Vanguard Award for Risk and Innovation, two Dora Mavor Moore Awards (Outstanding Performance, Outstanding New Play), RBC’s Emerging Playwright Award, The Lustrum Award (which recognizes the greatest moments at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival) and was shortlisted for Amnesty International’s Freedom of Expression Award. The production garnered a five-star review in The\r\nGuardian Observer titled “a hard-hitting tour de force.” Huff has been published, translated into French, continues to tour, and was released as a podcast by the CBC.\r\n\r\nCliff Cardinal’s CBC Special, a songwriter/storyteller performance, toured festivals in Ottawa, Calgary, St. Catharines, through Canada’s North starting in Yellowknife with a stint at Theatre Kingston and won the Jon Kaplan Spotlight Award for the top performance at Toronto’s SummerWorks Festival.

Is that possible? \nCalled “sly, funny, and charming” by the Toronto Star, As You Like It Or The Land Acknowledgement by cultural provocateur Cliff Cardinal, is a devastating yet laugh-out-loud examination of land acknowledgements as cultural and political practice. A timeless tale of mistaken identities, banishment, and forgiveness takes on an entirely new meaning in this subversive update of the Bard’s classic. Cardinal’s Cree and Lakota heritage deeply inform his take on the play, which is acerbic, mischievous, and fearlessly deals with difficult subject matter.\n“The Canadian arts surprise of the year” (The Globe and Mai), William Shakespeare’s As You Like It, A Radical Retelling by Cliff Cardinal was the recipient the prestigious Governor General’s Literary Award for Drama and was shortlisted for the Ontario Trillium Book Award.\n“One thing’s certain: this As You Like It is unlike any other production of the play, past or future.”   NOW Magazine\nAges 14+\nCliff Cardinal – Creator and Writer\nNamed by The Globe and Mail as a Canadian Cultural Icon in 2022, Cliff Cardinal is a polarizing writer and performer known for his black humour and compassionate poeticism. His AS YOU LIKE IT, A RADICAL RETELLING has been performed across Canada, was shortlisted for the Ontario Trillium Book Award, and was the recipient of the prestigious Governor General’s Literary Award for Drama. Other solo theatre productions including Stitch, Huff, Cliff Cardinal’s CBC Special, and (Everyone I Love Has) A Terrible Fate (Befall Them) have toured across Canada and won numerous awards. He is an associate artist at VideoCabaret where he develops his new work. Born on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation, he studied\nplaywriting at the National Theatre School of Canada and fronts the hilarious and nefarious Cliff Cardinal and The Skylarks.\nCardinal’s first multi-character play, Too Good To Be True, opened VideoCabaret’s 2019 season at The Busy Street Theatre in Toronto with Cardinal himself directing. A workshop version of the script debuted at Summerworks ’13, where NOW Magazine said, “This captivating tale of an off-grid mother and her desperate children solidifies Cardinal as one of the most talented and intriguing writers in the country.” Prior to premiering AS YOU LIKE IT, A RADICAL RETELLING, Cardinal was best known for his one-man play Huff, which he has performed over 200 times. This harrowing yet hilarious show about youth who abuse solvent, at high risk of suicide won the Buddies in Bad Times’ Vanguard Award for Risk and Innovation, two Dora Mavor Moore Awards (Outstanding Performance, Outstanding New Play), RBC’s Emerging Playwright Award, The Lustrum Award (which recognizes the greatest moments at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival) and was shortlisted for Amnesty International’s Freedom of Expression Award. The production garnered a five-star review in The\nGuardian Observer titled “a hard-hitting tour de force.” Huff has been published, translated into French, continues to tour, and was released as a podcast by the CBC.\nCliff Cardinal’s CBC Special, a songwriter/storyteller performance, toured festivals in Ottawa, Calgary, St. Catharines, through Canada’s North starting in Yellowknife with a stint at Theatre Kingston and won the Jon Kaplan Spotlight Award for the top performance at Toronto’s SummerWorks Festival. Cliff Cardinal and The Skylarks’ first recording, This is Not a Mistake was released in 2016 and their follow up Gonna Be Fine was released in 2020, both are available online. The band’s third album Suicidal Valentine is out on Merlainen Music.

At 28, KRUT is an assured performing artist; her compelling, soulful performances evoke both folk traditions and modern sensibilities, with pop and jazz flourishes. A Eurovision finalist, she often represents Ukraine at official events and performs for soldiers in the current war zone, and she has appeared at the Edinburgh International Culture Summit, Andalucia Big Festival, Montreal Ukrainian Festival, and on other international stages.\r\n\r\nThe bandura’s harpsichord-like sound is both delicate and assertive. KRUT’s instrument has an astonishing 64 strings stretched over a single piece of wood, with 13 bass strings stretched along a short, fretless neck, and the remaining treble strings stretched across a large soundboard. She plays the bass set with her left hand, while the right plays across the prodigious treble array. In addition to being a masterful instrumentalist, KRUT’s striking, powerful voice soars in an acoustic setting, whether with a string quartet or solo.\r\n\r\nEarly bandurists were male balladeers who travelled from village to village; early in her career, says KRUT, “I dyed my hair pink, painted my nails black, wore leather jackets and started to play the bandura in a more modern, jazzy and funky way” (Vogue Australia). Now she’s stretching her style back toward the bandura’s folk roots. “[Her music] represents the DNA of Ukrainian culture, in all its styles, classic and very modern” (Ouest France)."

At 28, KRUT is an assured performing artist; her compelling, soulful performances evoke both folk traditions and modern sensibilities, with pop and jazz flourishes. A Eurovision finalist, she often represents Ukraine at official events and performs for soldiers in the current war zone, and she has appeared at the Edinburgh International Culture Summit, Andalucia Big Festival, Montreal Ukrainian Festival, and on other international stages.\nKRUT (pronounced “kroot”) is a Ukrainian singer and virtuoso of the bandura, a stringed instrument unique to Ukraine that looks and sounds like a hybrid of lute and harp. At 28, KRUT is an assured performing artist; her compelling, soulful performances evoke both folk traditions and modern sensibilities, with pop and jazz flourishes. A Eurovision finalist, she often represents Ukraine at official events and performs for soldiers in the current war zone, and she has appeared at the Edinburgh International Culture Summit, Andalucia Big Festival, Montreal Ukrainian Festival, and on other international stages.\nThe bandura’s harpsichord-like sound is both delicate and assertive. KRUT’s instrument has an astonishing 64 strings stretched over a single piece of wood, with 13 bass strings stretched along a short, fretless neck, and the remaining treble strings stretched across a large soundboard. She plays the bass set with her left hand, while the right plays across the prodigious treble array. In addition to being a masterful instrumentalist, KRUT’s striking, powerful voice soars in an acoustic setting, whether with a string quartet or solo.\nEarly bandurists were male balladeers who travelled from village to village; early in her career, says KRUT, “I dyed my hair pink, painted my nails black, wore leather jackets and started to play the bandura in a more modern, jazzy and funky way” (Vogue Australia). Now she’s stretching her style back toward the bandura’s folk roots. “[Her music] represents the DNA of Ukrainian culture, in all its styles, classic and very modern” (Ouest France).\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t"

A Considered Cabaret”.  Musical direction by Henry Koperski.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nIn a statement, Cumming said, “I’ve got to know Ari over the last few years, both socially and when he interviewed me for a couple of events.  The last time was an evening in D.C., and by the end of it I realized our chemistry and the unusual combo of us, as well as the fact that Ari has an amazing voice, would make for a really great cabaret show.  And kapow!  We’re doing it!  What I love most is it’s fresh and ever-changing.”\r\n\r\nShapiro added, “When Alan first suggested that we create a show together, I didn't quite believe him.  Then as we started to dig in to this collaboration, I realized how much our professional lives actually complement each other.  We’re both storytellers who try to help audiences better understand themselves and the world around them.  This show lets us explore those shared ideals on stage together, through stories and songs.”"

Uniting what would seem to be impossible – traditional Newfoundland music with the swing jazz of the legendary Django Reinhardt, Andrews makes it not just work – he makes it soar. The Juno award winning producer, composer, guitarist and globetrotting performer’s latest album is the best evidence yet of his truly unique musical vision and is the sound of him, literally, bringing it all back home.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA native of the island of Newfoundland, off the east coast of Canada, Duane grew up exposed to the island’s mélange of cultural influences and his development as a guitarist reflects that. After graduating from the Jazz Studies program at St. FXU with honours, Duane spent several years studying contemporary music composition at the Conservatoire International de Paris and at the Conservatoire National de Region in Marseille, France.\r\n\r\nHis discography starts with the release of his debut solo CD, simply titled, Duane Andrews (2004), which led to the multiple award winning Crocus (2006), then Raindrops (2008), which features a collaboration with the Atlantic String Quartet and two albums with Cape Breton master fiddler Dwayne Côté, Dwayne Côté and Duane Andrews (2010) and The Empress (2012).\r\n\r\nOther notable collaborations include Charlie’s Boogie (2013) with bluegrass guitarist/singer/songwriter extraordinaire Craig Young which evolved into Fretboard Journey (2016) with the addition of fellow Newfoundland guitarists Sandy Morris and Gordon Quinton. Playing regular Sunday sessions in Quidi Vidi, NL with accordionist Aaron Collis resulted in The Mallard Cottage Sessions (2015) and his most recent collaboration, the Juno award winning More Sheep, Less Sleep (2015) from The Swinging Belles with children’s educators Erin Power and Laura Winter, can be found at www.theswingingbelles.ca.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nPRESS\r\n\r\n“the music might be best described as Folk music played by a top Jazz guitarist and the result is refreshing and stunning. Highly recommended.”\r\nFolkworld Magazine, Germany\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“…startlingly good…”\r\nNOW Magazine, Toronto\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“…it was the group’s infectious versions of well-known Reinhardt tunes that drew the biggest applause.

The Juno award winning producer, composer, guitarist and globetrotting performer’s latest album is the best evidence yet of his truly unique musical vision and is the sound of him, literally, bringing it all back home.\n\n\nA native of the island of Newfoundland, off the east coast of Canada, Duane grew up exposed to the island’s mélange of cultural influences and his development as a guitarist reflects that. After graduating from the Jazz Studies program at St. FXU with honours, Duane spent several years studying contemporary music composition at the Conservatoire International de Paris and at the Conservatoire National de Region in Marseille, France.\nHis discography starts with the release of his debut solo CD, simply titled, Duane Andrews (2004), which led to the multiple award winning Crocus (2006), then Raindrops (2008), which features a collaboration with the Atlantic String Quartet and two albums with Cape Breton master fiddler Dwayne Côté, Dwayne Côté and Duane Andrews (2010) and The Empress (2012).\nOther notable collaborations include Charlie’s Boogie (2013) with bluegrass guitarist/singer/songwriter extraordinaire Craig Young which evolved into Fretboard Journey (2016) with the addition of fellow Newfoundland guitarists Sandy Morris and Gordon Quinton. Playing regular Sunday sessions in Quidi Vidi, NL with accordionist Aaron Collis resulted in The Mallard Cottage Sessions (2015) and his most recent collaboration, the Juno award winning More Sheep, Less Sleep (2015) from The Swinging Belles with children’s educators Erin Power and Laura Winter, can be found at www.theswingingbelles.ca.\n \nPRESS\n“the music might be best described as Folk music played by a top Jazz guitarist and the result is refreshing and stunning. Highly recommended.”\nFolkworld Magazine, Germany\n\n“…startlingly good…”\nNOW Magazine, Toronto\n\n“…it was the group’s infectious versions of well-known Reinhardt tunes that drew the biggest applause. But it was the group’s bubbling stew of styles on Newfoundland classics that still echoed after the last notes faded.”\nThe Ottawa Citizen, Ottawa\nAWARDS\nNewfoundland and Labrador Arts Council\n2017 Artist of the Year Award\n2006 Emerging Artist of the Year Award\nAtlantic Film Festival\n2018 Best Original Score (An Audience Of Chairs)\n2009 Best Original Score (Crackie)\nBritish Documentary Film Festival\n2017 Best Music (Meet Maurice Crosby)\nThe Nickel Film Festival\n2016 Best Original Score (for Terra Nova Matadora)\nJuno\n2016 Children’s Album of the Year Award (with The Swinging Belles)\nMusicNL\n2018 Fans Choice Award (with The Swinging Belles)\n2017 Instrumental Album Award (with Fretboard Journey)\n2016 Male Artist and Jazz/Blues Album Awards\n2015 Traditional Album Award (with Aaron Collis)\n2014 Instrumental Album Award (with Craig Young)\n2012 Jazz Album of the Year Award (with Dwayne Côté)\n2010 Instrumental Album Award (with Dwayne Côté)\n2008 Male Artist, Album, SOCAN Songwriter, Jazz Album of the Year Awards\n2006 Jazz/Blues Artist of the Year Award\n2004 Jazz/Blues Artist of the Year Award, Rising Star Nominee\nIndependent Music Awards\n2014 Jazz Single Nominee\n2011 Instrumental Album Award (with Dwayne Cote)\n2008 Jazz Single and Album Nominee\n2006 Jazz Album Award\nECMA\n2017 Traditional Instrumental Recording of the Year Award (with Fretboard Journey)\n2016 Roots/Traditional Group of the Year Award Nominee (with Aaron Collis)\n2014 Traditional Instrumental Recording of the Year Award (with Craig Young)\n2012 Roots/Traditional Group of the Year Award Nominee (with Dwayne Côté)\n2011 Instrumental and Jazz Album of the Year Award (with Dwayne Côté)\n2010 Album and Producer of the Year Nominee\n2009 Instrumental Album of the Year Award, Male Artist Nominee\n2007 Jazz Album of the Year Award\n2006 Instrumental Album of the Year Award, Male Artist Nominee\n2005 Jazz Album of the Year Award, Emerging Artist Nominee\nCanadian Folk Music Awards\n2016 Instrumental Artist Award\n2015 Children’s Album Award (with The Swinging Belles)\n2007 Best World Artist (Solo) Nominee\n2005 Best Instrumental Artist (Solo) Nominee, Best World Artist (Solo) Nominee, Pushing the Boundries Nominee\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tPerformer's Website Page\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tDuane Andrews and the Hot Club of Conception Bay featuring Ray Legere - Official Website\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t"

        "@value": "THE PEKING ACROBATS®\r\n\r\nFor the last thirty two years, THE PEKING ACROBATS® have redefined audience perceptions of Chinese acrobatics. They perform daring maneuvers atop a precarious pagoda of chairs and display their technical prowess at such arts as trick-cycling, precision tumbling, juggling, somersaulting, and gymnastics. They push the limits of human ability, defying gravity with\r\namazing displays of contortion, flexibility, and control. THE PEKING ACROBATS are often accompanied by live musicians who skillfully play traditional Chinese instruments; the time-\r\nhonored Chinese music coalesces with high-tech special effects and awe-inspiring acrobatic feats, creating an exuberant entertainment event with the festive pageantry of a Chinese Carnival.\r\n\r\nSince their founding in 1986, THE PEKING ACROBATS have been featured on numerous television shows and celebrity-studded TV specials. These include Nickelodeon’s Unfabulous, Ellen’s Really Big Show (hosted by Ellen DeGeneres), The Wayne Brady Show, That’s Incredible, ABC's Wide World of Sports, and NBC's Ring In The New Year Holiday Special. They have also appeared on HDNet TV's In Focusseries, and have appeared regularly in 3D on NBC/Comcast's new 3D Channel. THE PEKING ACROBATS set the world record for the Human Chair Stack on FOX Network's Guinness Book Primetime television show in 1999: they balanced six people precariously atop six chairs twenty one feet up in the air without safety lines, astounding audiences with their bravery and dexterity. THE PEKING ACROBATS have also made their way onto the silver screen – company members were featured in Steven Soderbergh's hit film Ocean's Eleven playing alongside Julia Roberts, Brad Pitt and George Clooney. PEKING ACROBATS' alumnus Shaobo Qin also appeared in that film's two\r\nsequels, Ocean's Twelve and Ocean's Thirteen.\r\n\r\nTHE PEKING ACROBATS achieved another milestone in the fall of 2003, when they made their orchestral debut at the Hollywood Bowl in Los Angeles, CA. They performed as part of the\r\nHollywood Bowl’s Fireworks Season Finale, where the company blended their unique brand of acrobatics with the majestic sound of the 100-piece Hollywood Bowl Orchestra, conducted by John Mauceri. Since their Hollywood Bowl debut, THE PEKING ACROBATS have performed with many of the most prestigious Symphony Orchestras in North America today. These include the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra; the Ravinia Festival Orchestra, featuring members of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra; the San Diego Symphony Orchestra; the Cincinnati Pops Orchestra; the Buffalo Philharmonic Orchestra; and the San Francisco Symphony Orchestra. THE PEKING ACROBATS return often to the Hollywood Bowl, where they perform with the Hollywood Bowl Orchestra as Special Guest Artists.\r\n\r\nOver their thirty-one year career, THE PEKING ACROBATS have achieved international acclaim, dazzling audiences around the world. In February of 2005, THE PEKING ACROBATS premiered in Italy on a five-week, twelve-city tour. Their opening in Milan became a spectacular media event that was covered nationally by the Italian press. In city after city, THE\r\nPEKING ACROBATS took stage before sold-out crowds, and the reviews were filled with accolades attesting to their superb performances. Since their Italian debut, THE PEKING\r\nACROBATS have performed in seven European countries on their six European Tours between 2005 and today.\r\n\r\nTHE PEKING ACROBATS are part of a time-honored Chinese tradition, rooted in centuries of Chinese history and folk art. Tradition demands that each generation of acrobats add its own improvements and embellishments; because of this, high honor is conferred upon those skilled enough to become acrobats. THE PEKING ACROBATS seek to uphold this rich and ancient folk art tradition, bringing it to new technical heights while integrating twenty-first century technology. In the words of Clive Davis of the New York Post, \"THE PEKING ACROBATS [are] pushing the envelope of human possibility,” combining agility and grace in remarkable feats of “pure artistry.”"

They perform daring maneuvers atop a precarious pagoda of chairs and display their technical prowess at such arts as trick-cycling, precision tumbling, juggling, somersaulting, and gymnastics. They push the limits of human ability, defying gravity with\namazing displays of contortion, flexibility, and control. THE PEKING ACROBATS are often accompanied by live musicians who skillfully play traditional Chinese instruments; the time-\nhonored Chinese music coalesces with high-tech special effects and awe-inspiring acrobatic feats, creating an exuberant entertainment event with the festive pageantry of a Chinese Carnival.\nSince their founding in 1986, THE PEKING ACROBATS have been featured on numerous television shows and celebrity-studded TV specials. These include Nickelodeon’s Unfabulous, Ellen’s Really Big Show (hosted by Ellen DeGeneres), The Wayne Brady Show, That’s Incredible, ABC’s Wide World of Sports, and NBC’s Ring In The New Year Holiday Special. They have also appeared on HDNet TV’s In Focusseries, and have appeared regularly in 3D on NBC/Comcast’s new 3D Channel. THE PEKING ACROBATS set the world record for the Human Chair Stack on FOX Network’s Guinness Book Primetime television show in 1999: they balanced six people precariously atop six chairs twenty one feet up in the air without safety lines, astounding audiences with their bravery and dexterity. THE PEKING ACROBATS have also made their way onto the silver screen – company members were featured in Steven Soderbergh’s hit film Ocean’s Eleven playing alongside Julia Roberts, Brad Pitt and George Clooney. PEKING ACROBATS’ alumnus Shaobo Qin also appeared in that film’s two\nsequels, Ocean’s Twelve and Ocean’s Thirteen.\nTHE PEKING ACROBATS achieved another milestone in the fall of 2003, when they made their orchestral debut at the Hollywood Bowl in Los Angeles, CA. They performed as part of the\nHollywood Bowl’s Fireworks Season Finale, where the company blended their unique brand of acrobatics with the majestic sound of the 100-piece Hollywood Bowl Orchestra, conducted by John Mauceri. Since their Hollywood Bowl debut, THE PEKING ACROBATS have performed with many of the most prestigious Symphony Orchestras in North America today. These include the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra; the Ravinia Festival Orchestra, featuring members of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra; the San Diego Symphony Orchestra; the Cincinnati Pops Orchestra; the Buffalo Philharmonic Orchestra; and the San Francisco Symphony Orchestra. THE PEKING ACROBATS return often to the Hollywood Bowl, where they perform with the Hollywood Bowl Orchestra as Special Guest Artists.\nOver their thirty-one year career, THE PEKING ACROBATS have achieved international acclaim, dazzling audiences around the world. In February of 2005, THE PEKING ACROBATS premiered in Italy on a five-week, twelve-city tour. Their opening in Milan became a spectacular media event that was covered nationally by the Italian press. In city after city, THE\nPEKING ACROBATS took stage before sold-out crowds, and the reviews were filled with accolades attesting to their superb performances. Since their Italian debut, THE PEKING\nACROBATS have performed in seven European countries on their six European Tours between 2005 and today.\nTHE PEKING ACROBATS are part of a time-honored Chinese tradition, rooted in centuries of Chinese history and folk art. Tradition demands that each generation of acrobats add its own improvements and embellishments; because of this, high honor is conferred upon those skilled enough to become acrobats. THE PEKING ACROBATS seek to uphold this rich and ancient folk art tradition, bringing it to new technical heights while integrating twenty-first century technology. In the words of Clive Davis of the New York Post, “THE PEKING ACROBATS [are] pushing the envelope of human possibility,” combining agility and grace in remarkable feats of “pure artistry.”\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t"

They have released three albums (2013, 2015, 2019) and have toured extensively throughout North America, including a sold-out show at the Skirball Centre in Los Angeles in 2019. They have been nominated for four Canadian Folk Music Awards, including Best Traditional Singer and Best Ensemble. The six-piece Toronto-based world music ensemble is fronted by Jewish-Indigenous  powerhouse vocalist and dancer Tamar Ilana, and features the city’s finest world musicians. They perform in over 20 languages such as Ladino, Spanish, Bulgarian, Macedonian, Hebrew, French, Romani and Arabic, drawing inspiration from today’s worldwide themes of migration and the questioning of one’s identity. \r\n\r\nTamar’s childhood was spent gathering songs from small villages on the edge of the Mediterranean and dancing flamenco, and Ventanas’ band members are from across the globe. Together, and in true Canadian fashion, they intertwine their musical cultures to create an all-encompassing world of their own in which they lead audiences down the less traveled paths of the Mediterranean, mixing in contemporary interpretations of ancient ballads, original compositions and new choreographies, inviting audiences of all backgrounds into their lives and music.\r\n\r\nThroughout the pandemic, Ventanas served as the house band for the new performing arts organization, FabCollab and the Women in Song series, collaborating with primarily BIPOC world class women artists such as Tara Moneka (Iraq), Eliana Cuevas (Venezuela), OKAN (Cuba), Aline Morales (Brazil), Maryem Tollar (Egypt), Kaeja d’Dance (Canada), Dimitra Kahrimanidis (Greece), Nastasia Y (Ukraine) and others, in iconic Toronto venues such as Koerner Hall, the Aga Khan Museum and Lula Lounge. This series was also live-streamed by the National Arts Centre garnering over 100,000 online views. \r\n\r\nVentanas has toured throughout Canada, the United States and Colombia. \r\n\r\nVentanas lineup:\r\n\r\nTamar Ilana - vocals, dance \r\nDemetri Petsalakis - oud, keys\r\nJessica Deutsch - violin, vocals \r\nBenjamin Barrile - flamenco guitar \r\nTyler Emond - upright and electric bass \r\nDerek Gray - drumset, percussion \r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nTamar Ilana bio\r\n\r\n Tamar Ilana is a Toronto-born multifaceted artist who grew up on stage singing in multiple languages, touring internationally and dancing flamenco since a very young age. Of Jewish-Indigenous-Romanian-Scottish descent, Tamar sings in 20 languages and is most influenced by the Sephardic and Flamenco traditions. \r\n\r\nTamar’s music and fierce talent reflect her personal and cultural history growing up in multicultural Toronto; accompanying her ethnomusicologist mother, Dr. Judith Cohen, on village fieldwork expeditions and on stage as a child; and living in Ibiza, Barcelona, Paris and Seville as a teen and young adult. Drawing on these experiences, Tamar founded her world music project, Ventanas, in 2011 with whom she has released three albums and been nominated for four Canadian Folk Music Awards including Best Traditional Singer. Tamar has collaborated with such renowned artists as Jesse Cook, Briga, Eliana Cuevas, Lenka Lichtenberg, Jaffa Road, Sultans of String, the Lemon Bucket Orkestra, and Tara Moneka. A highly sought-after flamenco dancer and singer, Tamar performs with the Esmeralda Enrique Spanish Dance Company, and at the Academy of Spanish Dance. Tamar has also been featured in award-winning, innovative international musicals in New York, San Francisco, Washington DC, the UK and Germany. \r\n\r\nIn 2020, Tamar co-founded the presenting arts organization FabCollab, and has since presented over 100 BIPOC women and minority artists at venues such as Koerner Hall and the Aga Khan Museum.

They have released three albums (2013, 2015, 2019) and have toured extensively throughout North America, including a sold-out show at the Skirball Centre in Los Angeles in 2019. They have been nominated for four Canadian Folk Music Awards, including Best Traditional Singer and Best Ensemble. The six-piece Toronto-based world music ensemble is fronted by Jewish-Indigenous  powerhouse vocalist and dancer Tamar Ilana, and features the city’s finest world musicians.

Neither can live in the space of the other but, united through a child whom they each struggle to possess, a beautiful new blossom is formed.\r\n\r\nScene 2\r\nA newborn’s arrival is celebrated by the King and Queen of the Garden of Flowers. Everyone is excited from the lowliest seedlings to the most elegantly scented petals. Birds – handmaidens of the Lilac Fairy – arrive to bestow gifts of Beauty, Purity, and Elegance on the newborn child. The festivities are abruptly interrupted by Carabosse, who is outraged by not having received an invitation to the christening. In retaliation, he casts his spell: the newborn – Aurora – will live for 16 years in the upper world garden, after which she will prick her finger on a spindle and become subsumed as a thorn into the underworld. The Lilac Fairy, arriving late to the celebrations, is unable to reverse the spell, but is instead able to alter it so that Aurora will not become a thorn, but that the world of flowers will fall into a still sleep underneath the hedge of thorns that will rise around them. The spells can only be broken by true love’s kiss.\r\n\r\nScene 3\r\nHappy-go-lucky knitting and weaving seedlings go about their business until Carabosse crosses their path, sowing discord. Carabosse is on his way to ensure his spell is fulfilled.\r\n\r\nScene 4\r\nCelebrations are underway for Aurora’s sixteenth birthday. Arriving at the party Aurora has now grown into a vibrant and enchanting Rosebud. The young suitors swoon around her. An old lady appears, offering Aurora a beautiful golden spindle; before the King and Queen can take it from her, Aurora pricks her finger. Carabosse reveals himself and claims his prize, but before he can bring Aurora with him the Lilac Fairy arrives with her handmaiden. They fulfill the vow to protect Aurora and put all the flowers to sleep. Deadly weeds and thorns grow around the flowers, a hedge which only one who is pure of heart can get through without becoming entangled.\r\nACT II\r\nScene 1\r\nWith the flower garden long forgotten, new plants and trees have sprung forth. Celebrating the arrival of spring, a party of young revelers enjoys a picnic in a clearing in the forest. Among them there is one who is more distinguished than others named Florimund. The Lilac Fairy, searching for someone able to break the spell on Aurora, seizes the moment and guides him deeper into the forests.\r\n\r\nScene 2\r\nArriving at a lake deep in the forest, Florimund is surrounded by Naiads, water nymphs and servants of the Lilac Fairy. Rising out of the water, the Lilac Fairy conjures a vision that is so true of the beautiful Aurora that it feels real to the touch.\r\n\r\nScene 3\r\nFlorimund, smitten with love, is guided by the Lilac Fairy and plunges deeper into the forest to find the sleeping Aurora. At the edge of the world of Carabosse, the Lilac Fairy can go no further and sends Florimund forward to face the darkness on his own.\r\n\r\nScene 4\r\nCarabosse, jealously guarding his domain, is disturbed by the approaching Florimund and commands his destruction. Florimund almost succumbs to the thorns but at last fights his way through and breaks the spell with true love’s kiss.\r\n\r\nScene 5\r\nWith the spell broken, the Garden of Flowers blooms anew, bringing birds and flowers to celebrate the union of Aurora and Florimund. Aurora is no longer just a blossom: through the prick of his world, Carabosse still jealously guards the lovely flower we now call a Rose, bestowing the sting of sharp thorns on greedy fingers. The Rose has both flower and thorns, shared by the worlds of Carabosse and the Lilac Fairy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n&nbsp;"

Neither can live in the space of the other but, united through a child whom they each struggle to possess, a beautiful new blossom is formed.\nScene 2\nA newborn’s arrival is celebrated by the King and Queen of the Garden of Flowers. Everyone is excited from the lowliest seedlings to the most elegantly scented petals. Birds – handmaidens of the Lilac Fairy – arrive to bestow gifts of Beauty, Purity, and Elegance on the newborn child. The festivities are abruptly interrupted by Carabosse, who is outraged by not having received an invitation to the christening. In retaliation, he casts his spell: the newborn – Aurora – will live for 16 years in the upper world garden, after which she will prick her finger on a spindle and become subsumed as a thorn into the underworld. The Lilac Fairy, arriving late to the celebrations, is unable to reverse the spell, but is instead able to alter it so that Aurora will not become a thorn, but that the world of flowers will fall into a still sleep underneath the hedge of thorns that will rise around them. The spells can only be broken by true love’s kiss.\nScene 3\nHappy-go-lucky knitting and weaving seedlings go about their business until Carabosse crosses their path, sowing discord. Carabosse is on his way to ensure his spell is fulfilled.\nScene 4\nCelebrations are underway for Aurora’s sixteenth birthday. Arriving at the party Aurora has now grown into a vibrant and enchanting Rosebud. The young suitors swoon around her. An old lady appears, offering Aurora a beautiful golden spindle; before the King and Queen can take it from her, Aurora pricks her finger. Carabosse reveals himself and claims his prize, but before he can bring Aurora with him the Lilac Fairy arrives with her handmaiden. They fulfill the vow to protect Aurora and put all the flowers to sleep. Deadly weeds and thorns grow around the flowers, a hedge which only one who is pure of heart can get through without becoming entangled.\nACT II\nScene 1\nWith the flower garden long forgotten, new plants and trees have sprung forth. Celebrating the arrival of spring, a party of young revelers enjoys a picnic in a clearing in the forest. Among them there is one who is more distinguished than others named Florimund. The Lilac Fairy, searching for someone able to break the spell on Aurora, seizes the moment and guides him deeper into the forests.\nScene 2\nArriving at a lake deep in the forest, Florimund is surrounded by Naiads, water nymphs and servants of the Lilac Fairy. Rising out of the water, the Lilac Fairy conjures a vision that is so true of the beautiful Aurora that it feels real to the touch.\nScene 3\nFlorimund, smitten with love, is guided by the Lilac Fairy and plunges deeper into the forest to find the sleeping Aurora. At the edge of the world of Carabosse, the Lilac Fairy can go no further and sends Florimund forward to face the darkness on his own.\nScene 4\nCarabosse, jealously guarding his domain, is disturbed by the approaching Florimund and commands his destruction. Florimund almost succumbs to the thorns but at last fights his way through and breaks the spell with true love’s kiss.\nScene 5\nWith the spell broken, the Garden of Flowers blooms anew, bringing birds and flowers to celebrate the union of Aurora and Florimund. Aurora is no longer just a blossom: through the prick of his world, Carabosse still jealously guards the lovely flower we now call a Rose, bestowing the sting of sharp thorns on greedy fingers. The Rose has both flower and thorns, shared by the worlds of Carabosse and the Lilac Fairy.\n\n \n\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t"

Known in Quebec for his performances as the impersonator of British singer-drummer Phil Collins, Martin is nevertheless a jack-of-all-trades musician who loves to embark on new musical projects. \r\nBorn in Longueuil in 1971, he began learning the drums at the age of eight, and formed his first band at the age of thirteen! His passion for Phil Collins and Genesis was born during his adolescence, the group being at the height of its popularity during the 80s. Martin went so far as to change his drums from right-handed to left-handed to better reproduce the nuances of his idol's playing. Despite everything, Martin is a lover of music and he is constantly expanding his musical background by integrating new styles.\r\nHe composed his first songs in 1988, within the group The Bob’s . He participated in the Granby International Song Festival in 1996 and 1998, and was a finalist in both editions. His first album, “L’amour ou le sexe”, appeared in 2000, followed by “Levac” in 2001 and “Influences” in 2006, this album being composed during the last tour that Martin would do with a tribute group to the Genesis music during the Peter Gabriel period.\r\nHaving joined the group in 2002, it was from this moment that Martin professionally impersonated Phil Collins for the first time. He plays drums and vocal harmonies, and performs the song More Fool Me , as Phil did on the show Selling England by the Pound .\r\nDuring that same year, Martin and Phil met for the first time in the studios of radio station CKOI in Montreal, during the promotional tour for the British singer's album Testify . In February 2005, Martin and Phil met again in Geneva as part of a tour. Phil spends the day with the band and even takes Martin's place behind the drums for the encore! During his appearance on the Quebec show “Everybody talks about it” in 2010, Phil recognized Martin as his best interpreter and impersonator, his opinion going in the direction of the public and the critics.\r\nThis recognition allows Martin to share the stage with Phil Collins collaborators. Artists as talented as they are recognized, such as Daryl Stuermer, Ronnie Caryl and Amy Keys, among others.\r\nToday, Martin continues to thrill crowds across Quebec, with his two shows, Phil Collins &amp; Genesis and Collins/Gabriel. When not performing, Martin divides his time between songwriting and teaching vocals and drums.\r\n\r\n\r\n&nbsp;"

Sort of. It’s a multiverse picture without a single visual effect, unless you count the actors.\r\nSeveral years after their meet-cute at a wedding, Olive (Caroline Bell) and Benny (Ian Ottis Goff) are spending an entirely ordinary day at their lake house. Until, that is, things start to shift, little by little. At first it’s just an apparently misplaced package or some scrambled letters on the fridge. Then, it’s more meaningful stuff. And then, almost casually, Olive finds Benny replaced by a woman named Ada (Mallory Amirault), who can’t understand why Olive doesn’t know her. They’ve been together for years, after all.

Sort of. It’s a multiverse picture without a single visual effect, unless you count the actors.\nSeveral years after their meet-cute at a wedding, Olive (Caroline Bell) and Benny (Ian Ottis Goff) are spending an entirely ordinary day at their lake house. Until, that is, things start to shift, little by little. At first it’s just an apparently misplaced package or some scrambled letters on the fridge. Then, it’s more meaningful stuff. And then, almost casually, Olive finds Benny replaced by a woman named Ada (Mallory Amirault), who can’t understand why Olive doesn’t know her. They’ve been together for years, after all. Since they met at that wedding.\nThe debut feature from Fredericton filmmaker Arianna Martinez is easier to experience than describe.
