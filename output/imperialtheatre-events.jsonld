        "@value": "James Barker Band is proof that big dreams can grow from small-town roots. Fueled by friendship,\r\ngrit, and a shared love for storytelling, the band has gone from local dive bars to headlining\r\nstages across North America and Europe, amassing over 295 million global streams, multiple No.\r\n1 hits, and the unwavering devotion of fans along the way.\r\n\r\nThe story began in 2009 when James Barker (lead vocals/guitar) and Connor Stephen (drums)\r\nfirst met at band camp. Bonded by their passion for music, they teamed up with Taylor Abram\r\n(guitar/background vocals) and Bobby Martin (bass), who all grew up within an hour of each other\r\nin rural towns surrounding Toronto. The four-piece quickly became close friends, hitting the road\r\nin a rented Greyhound bus to play gigs wherever they could, pouring their heart into every note.\r\nThe band’s big break came in 2015 at the Emerging Artist Showcase at Boots and Hearts Music\r\nFestival, where their raw talent and undeniable charm earned them the top prize. That victory was\r\na launchpad, leading to a record deal with Universal Music Canada, the country’s leading music\r\ncompany, and the release of their breakout single, “Lawn Chair Lazy,” in 2017. The laid-back\r\nanthem quickly gained traction and earned Platinum certification, but it was just the beginning.\r\nTheir subsequent singles have also earned vast achievements and acclaim. Their 2x Platinum\r\nsingle “Chills,” charted at No. 1 in Canadian country music charts, peaked at #1 on the Billboard\r\nCanada Country chart, #49 on the American Billboard Country Chart, and was awarded Single of\r\nthe Year and Top Selling Canadian Single of the Year at the 2018 Canadian Country Music Awards,\r\njust a year after their major label signing. “Chills” also made history with the SOCAN Songwriter\r\nPrize nomination, which is the first-ever country music nomination for this prestigious all-genre\r\naward. The record-breaking track’s home album, Game On, is Gold certified and took home the\r\n2018 JUNO Award for Country Album of the Year.\r\n\r\nFollowing up on a stellar debut, the band released several fan and industry favourites like\r\nPlatinum-certified “Keep it Simple” which notched another No. 1 song of the year at the 2020 CCMA\r\nAwards and CMAO Awards. Their bustling catalogue has seen a string of successful tracks with\r\nfour No.1 Canadian Country radio hits - “Chills,” “Over All Over Again,” “Meet Your Mama,” and\r\n“New Old Trucks” feat. 14x GRAMMY-nominated artist Dierks Bentley. To date, they’ve racked up\r\n12 Gold and Platinum certifications, four No. 1 Canadian country radio hits, and three CCMA Fans’\r\nChoice Awards.\r\n\r\nBut beyond their record-breaking metrics and awards, James Barker Band’s magic lies in their\r\nconnection—to each other, to their roots, and to the fans who see themselves in their songs. Every\r\nnote they play is a tribute to the small towns that raised them, the families that support them, and\r\nthe communities that keep showing up to cheer them on. With their grounded ethos, infectious\r\nenergy, and heartfelt storytelling, James Barker Band has made it clear: they’re not just chasing\r\ndreams—they’re sharing them. As they continue their rise in Canada, Nashville, and beyond, the\r\nband remains the same four humble friends who started it all, proof that sometimes, the best\r\nstories come from the simplest beginnings.\r\n\r\nWith this, the multi-award-winning four-piece is continuing its steadfast ascent in Canada, Nashville\r\nand beyond. Fans are encouraged to stay up to date with JBB for more exciting announcements\r\non the way, on Instagram, Facebook, TikTok, YouTube and at JamesBarkerBand.com."

Fueled by friendship,\ngrit, and a shared love for storytelling, the band has gone from local dive bars to headlining\nstages across North America and Europe, amassing over 295 million global streams, multiple No.\n1 hits, and the unwavering devotion of fans along the way.\nThe story began in 2009 when James Barker (lead vocals/guitar) and Connor Stephen (drums)\nfirst met at band camp. Bonded by their passion for music, they teamed up with Taylor Abram\n(guitar/background vocals) and Bobby Martin (bass), who all grew up within an hour of each other\nin rural towns surrounding Toronto. The four-piece quickly became close friends, hitting the road\nin a rented Greyhound bus to play gigs wherever they could, pouring their heart into every note.\nThe band’s big break came in 2015 at the Emerging Artist Showcase at Boots and Hearts Music\nFestival, where their raw talent and undeniable charm earned them the top prize. That victory was\na launchpad, leading to a record deal with Universal Music Canada, the country’s leading music\ncompany, and the release of their breakout single, “Lawn Chair Lazy,” in 2017. The laid-back\nanthem quickly gained traction and earned Platinum certification, but it was just the beginning.\nTheir subsequent singles have also earned vast achievements and acclaim. Their 2x Platinum\nsingle “Chills,” charted at No. 1 in Canadian country music charts, peaked at #1 on the Billboard\nCanada Country chart, #49 on the American Billboard Country Chart, and was awarded Single of\nthe Year and Top Selling Canadian Single of the Year at the 2018 Canadian Country Music Awards,\njust a year after their major label signing. “Chills” also made history with the SOCAN Songwriter\nPrize nomination, which is the first-ever country music nomination for this prestigious all-genre\naward. The record-breaking track’s home album, Game On, is Gold certified and took home the\n2018 JUNO Award for Country Album of the Year.\nFollowing up on a stellar debut, the band released several fan and industry favourites like\nPlatinum-certified “Keep it Simple” which notched another No. 1 song of the year at the 2020 CCMA\nAwards and CMAO Awards. Their bustling catalogue has seen a string of successful tracks with\nfour No.1 Canadian Country radio hits – “Chills,” “Over All Over Again,” “Meet Your Mama,” and\n“New Old Trucks” feat. 14x GRAMMY-nominated artist Dierks Bentley. To date, they’ve racked up\n12 Gold and Platinum certifications, four No. 1 Canadian country radio hits, and three CCMA Fans’\nChoice Awards.\nBut beyond their record-breaking metrics and awards, James Barker Band’s magic lies in their\nconnection—to each other, to their roots, and to the fans who see themselves in their songs. Every\nnote they play is a tribute to the small towns that raised them, the families that support them, and\nthe communities that keep showing up to cheer them on. With their grounded ethos, infectious\nenergy, and heartfelt storytelling, James Barker Band has made it clear: they’re not just chasing\ndreams—they’re sharing them. As they continue their rise in Canada, Nashville, and beyond, the\nband remains the same four humble friends who started it all, proof that sometimes, the best\nstories come from the simplest beginnings.\nWith this, the multi-award-winning four-piece is continuing its steadfast ascent in Canada, Nashville\nand beyond. Fans are encouraged to stay up to date with JBB for more exciting announcements\non the way, on Instagram, Facebook, TikTok, YouTube and at JamesBarkerBand.com.\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tPerformer's Website Page\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tJames Barker Band - Official Website\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tPerformer's Facebook Page\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tJames Barker Band on Facebook\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tPerformer's Instagram Page\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tJames Barker Band on Instagram\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t"

Sort of. It’s a multiverse picture without a single visual effect, unless you count the actors.\r\nSeveral years after their meet-cute at a wedding, Olive (Caroline Bell) and Benny (Ian Ottis Goff) are spending an entirely ordinary day at their lake house. Until, that is, things start to shift, little by little. At first it’s just an apparently misplaced package or some scrambled letters on the fridge. Then, it’s more meaningful stuff. And then, almost casually, Olive finds Benny replaced by a woman named Ada (Mallory Amirault), who can’t understand why Olive doesn’t know her. They’ve been together for years, after all. Since they met at that wedding.\r\n\r\nThe debut feature from Fredericton filmmaker Arianna Martinez is easier to experience than describe. It’s a multiverse picture without a single visual effect, unless you count the actors. Working from a script she co-wrote with producer Gordon Mihan, Martinez keeps the storytelling clear and coherent even when her characters don’t know what’s happening, using a slightly theatrical style and making the most of a very limited budget. And New Brunswick stage actor and playwright Bell is sensational in her first film role as Olive. She glows — sometimes literally — as a woman slowly realizing she might not have been living the life she wants, and grappling with everything that means."

Sort of. It’s a multiverse picture without a single visual effect, unless you count the actors.\nSeveral years after their meet-cute at a wedding, Olive (Caroline Bell) and Benny (Ian Ottis Goff) are spending an entirely ordinary day at their lake house. Until, that is, things start to shift, little by little. At first it’s just an apparently misplaced package or some scrambled letters on the fridge. Then, it’s more meaningful stuff. And then, almost casually, Olive finds Benny replaced by a woman named Ada (Mallory Amirault), who can’t understand why Olive doesn’t know her. They’ve been together for years, after all. Since they met at that wedding.\nThe debut feature from Fredericton filmmaker Arianna Martinez is easier to experience than describe. It’s a multiverse picture without a single visual effect, unless you count the actors. Working from a script she co-wrote with producer Gordon Mihan, Martinez keeps the storytelling clear and coherent even when her characters don’t know what’s happening, using a slightly theatrical style and making the most of a very limited budget. And New Brunswick stage actor and playwright Bell is sensational in her first film role as Olive. She glows — sometimes literally — as a woman slowly realizing she might not have been living the life she wants, and grappling with everything that means.\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t"

Phil Collins &amp; Genesis… Live makes you relive the great songs that accompanied the most beautiful moments of your life! From the intimate to the universal, he takes us into the soundtrack of his life, which is also ours... It's a real journey through time, from the beginnings of Genesis to the great popular hits of Phil Collins. Surrounded by his faithful musicians, he shows us how this music has marked and transformed his life and career.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMartin Levac is a singer, drummer, keyboardist and singer-songwriter. Known in Quebec for his performances as the impersonator of British singer-drummer Phil Collins, Martin is nevertheless a jack-of-all-trades musician who loves to embark on new musical projects. \r\nBorn in Longueuil in 1971, he began learning the drums at the age of eight, and formed his first band at the age of thirteen! His passion for Phil Collins and Genesis was born during his adolescence, the group being at the height of its popularity during the 80s. Martin went so far as to change his drums from right-handed to left-handed to better reproduce the nuances of his idol's playing. Despite everything, Martin is a lover of music and he is constantly expanding his musical background by integrating new styles.\r\nHe composed his first songs in 1988, within the group The Bob’s . He participated in the Granby International Song Festival in 1996 and 1998, and was a finalist in both editions. His first album, “L’amour ou le sexe”, appeared in 2000, followed by “Levac” in 2001 and “Influences” in 2006, this album being composed during the last tour that Martin would do with a tribute group to the Genesis music during the Peter Gabriel period.\r\nHaving joined the group in 2002, it was from this moment that Martin professionally impersonated Phil Collins for the first time. He plays drums and vocal harmonies, and performs the song More Fool Me , as Phil did on the show Selling England by the Pound .\r\nDuring that same year, Martin and Phil met for the first time in the studios of radio station CKOI in Montreal, during the promotional tour for the British singer's album Testify . In February 2005, Martin and Phil met again in Geneva as part of a tour. Phil spends the day with the band and even takes Martin's place behind the drums for the encore! During his appearance on the Quebec show “Everybody talks about it” in 2010, Phil recognized Martin as his best interpreter and impersonator, his opinion going in the direction of the public and the critics.\r\nThis recognition allows Martin to share the stage with Phil Collins collaborators. Artists as talented as they are recognized, such as Daryl Stuermer, Ronnie Caryl and Amy Keys, among others.\r\nToday, Martin continues to thrill crowds across Quebec, with his two shows, Phil Collins &amp; Genesis and Collins/Gabriel. When not performing, Martin divides his time between songwriting and teaching vocals and drums.\r\n\r\n\r\n&nbsp;"

Filmed at the Warner Theatre in Washington, D.C., Tom holds nothing back, as his kids are finally out of the house and it’s just him, his wife and a bunch of animals ready to return to their glory days. Tom has seen a lot over the years, from close calls with a pachinko ball to late night 7-Eleven runs, and he’s sharing all his thoughts as he parties on into the next stage of life. Papa’s other specials include What A Day!, You’re Doing Great!, Human Mule, Freaked Out and Tom Papa Live in New York City, two of which were directed by Rob Zombie. \r\n\r\nIn 2023, Tom released his highly anticipated third book, We’re All In This Together…So Make Some Room. The book compiles comedic essays that aim to unite us through our stupidity. Every mistake has already been made, and this should bring us great comfort as we join together in our fight for survival, or at least in our attempt to get through the day. Whether we like it or not, we're all in this together.  \r\n\r\nIn 2020, he released his second book, You’re Doing Great! - And Other Reasons To Stay Alive, which was the follow-up to Your Dad Stole My Rake: And Other Family Dilemmas both released by St Martin’s Press, making “Summer Must Read” lists from Parade Magazine to The New York Post. Tom is also a contributing writer to the New Yorker Magazine.   \r\n\r\nTom is the host of the weekly podcast, Breaking Bread with Tom Papa, which features Tom and his guest eating, drinking, and celebrating the true meaning of breaking bread with insightful, revealing and always funny conversations. He also hosts the popular daily Netflix radio show, What A Joke With Papa And Fortune on Sirius XM Channel 93 and the monthly show, Come To Papa Live on Channel 94.  \r\n\r\nPapa has starred in many fan-favorite films including Paper Spiders where he stared opposite Lily Taylor, The Informant opposite Matt Damon, Analyze That opposite Robert DeNiro, and The Haunted World of El Superbeasto opposite Paul Giamatti, where Tom played the voice of El Superbeasto. He can also be seen alongside Michael Douglas and Matt Damon in the HBO film, Behind the Candelabra, which was directed by Steven Soderbergh and won 11 Emmys.\r\n\r\nOn TV, Tom hosted the NBC series, The Marriage Ref, which ran for two seasons and had a recurring role opposite Julia Louis-Dreyfus on the CBS series, The New Adventures of Old Christine.\r\n\r\nTom is currently on his The Grateful Bread Tour.

There are so\r\nmany moments peppered throughout the 30-year history of Canadian indie rock heroes Sloan that set\r\nthem well apart from the pack. From the band’s earliest home studio recordings that married their pop\r\nsmarts with fizzy, fuzzed out guitars, right up to later efforts that contain multitudes in their track\r\nlistings, ranging from Dylanesque streams of consciousness to short, sharp blasts of power pop -\r\nSomehow, it all remains quintessentially Sloan.\r\n\r\nThe band are credited as being a main instigator for the Canadian East Coast alternative scene of the\r\nearly 90s, garnering comparisons to the Seattle Grunge movement on the opposite coast. Over the\r\ncourse of their quarter-century career, Sloan have amassed an outstanding collection of over 250 songs\r\nand more than 30 singles with airplay at Canadian Rock Radio. Sloan have received nine Juno Award\r\nnominations and won for Best Alternative Album in 1997. The band was named one of Canada’s top five\r\nbands of all-time in a CBC critics poll."

There are so\nmany moments peppered throughout the 30-year history of Canadian indie rock heroes Sloan that set\nthem well apart from the pack. From the band’s earliest home studio recordings that married their pop\nsmarts with fizzy, fuzzed out guitars, right up to later efforts that contain multitudes in their track\nlistings, ranging from Dylanesque streams of consciousness to short, sharp blasts of power pop –\nSomehow, it all remains quintessentially Sloan.\nThe band are credited as being a main instigator for the Canadian East Coast alternative scene of the\nearly 90s, garnering comparisons to the Seattle Grunge movement on the opposite coast. Over the\ncourse of their quarter-century career, Sloan have amassed an outstanding collection of over 250 songs\nand more than 30 singles with airplay at Canadian Rock Radio. Sloan have received nine Juno Award\nnominations and won for Best Alternative Album in 1997. The band was named one of Canada’s top five\nbands of all-time in a CBC critics poll.\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tPerformer's Website Page\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSloan - Official Website\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t"

With a deep history of success, Desman exploded onto the scene, making waves across the country with his signature sound and style. He left a lasting mark on an entire generation of Canadians, earning him a Platinum-selling album, five Platinum certified singles, multiple chart-topping radio hits, and a slew of awards, including a JUNO for R&B/Soul Recording of the Year, three MMVAs, and multiple SOCAN Awards for songwriting. In 2023, Desman made an unprecedented return to the stage, headlining the OVO All Canadian North Stars show and releasing his Top 10 radio smash “Maniac”.\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tPerformer's Website Page\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tShawn Desman - Official Website\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t"

Experiencing the band GYPSY is truly a musically authentic event.\r\n\r\nVocals by Sharon Resky, Jon Cornwall (keyboards &amp; guitar) and Sheila Lamplugh (keyboards) blend like Steve Nicks, Lindsay Buckingham, and the late great Christine McVie. Don Morash's guitar playing makes you feel like Lindsay Buckingham is in the songs. Aran Hill plays a fretless bass that John McVie would be proud to listen to. Maurice Nadeau, drummer for GYPSY, lays down an excellent beat and even looks a bit like Mick Fleetwood.\r\n\r\nDon't miss GYPSY -- the band that gives you Fleetwood Mac, songs of Stevie Nicks and even her duet with Tom Petty."

Songs such as “Dreams”, “Go Your Own Way”, “Rhiannon” “Don’t Stop”, “The Chain”, and “Edge of 17” bring memories flooding back. Experiencing the band GYPSY is truly a musically authentic event.\nVocals by Sharon Resky, Jon Cornwall (keyboards & guitar) and Sheila Lamplugh (keyboards) blend like Steve Nicks, Lindsay Buckingham, and the late great Christine McVie. Don Morash’s guitar playing makes you feel like Lindsay Buckingham is in the songs. Aran Hill plays a fretless bass that John McVie would be proud to listen to. Maurice Nadeau, drummer for GYPSY, lays down an excellent beat and even looks a bit like Mick Fleetwood.\nDon’t miss GYPSY — the band that gives you Fleetwood Mac, songs of Stevie Nicks and even her duet with Tom Petty.\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t"

        "@value": "CCMA winners, and beloved Canadian country superstars George Canyon and Aaron Pritchett unite for their coast to coast Cowboy Christmas tour. With countless accolades between them, and over 25 years of hits, the pair will come together to treat fans to some of their own chart topping songs, as well as some all-time favorite Christmas classics. Truly a show not to be missed, in celebration of the Holiday season.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nGEORGE CANYON  \r\n\r\nGeorge Canyon rose to becoming one of Canada’s hottest Country Music stars in the early 2000’s and has won countless accolades and awards, including Juno Awards, CCMA Awards, and ECMA Awards to name a few. He has been inducted into the Nova Scotia Country Music Hall of Fame, recorded 12 albums, and was presented a certified Platinum Award for his debut album ‘One Good Friend’. With country iconic hits like Just Like You, I Believe in Angels, Drinkin’ Thinkin’, Daughters of the Sun, I Got This, I Want You To Live, Slow Dance and many, many more, he is also a highly regarded humanitarian, strong supporter of the military, and, most important, a proud father and devoted husband. \r\n\r\nCanyon’s tireless work as spokesperson for the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation (JDRF) and his ongoing support for Canada’s Armed Forces has earned him much National and International recognition. Among them, he was honored with the Humanitarian Award by the Canadian Country Music Association, the Queen's Diamond Jubilee Medal, and was also made the first ever Colonel Commandant of the Royal Canadian Air Cadets by the Honourable Peter MacKay, former Minister of National Defense.\r\n\r\nOutside of his music and charitable work, many people might also recognize George for his numerous roles on the big screen. From Charlie Wells in the hit television show Heartland and the head forest ranger in Trailer Park Boys, to Bull Shelton in the Hallmark Channel’s highest-rated original Christmas movie “One Starry Christmas”. George also guest starred on stage in the musical production of Grease in 2018 at the Winter Garden Theatre in Toronto.\r\n\r\nAmong his many identities, Canyon is also a proud Canadian and huge hockey fan, and roots for his team, the Calgary Flames, for which he is in his sixth season singing the national anthem during the home games.\r\n\r\nGeorge released his new memoir on November 8th, 2022 with Simon &amp; Schuster Canada, titled ‘My Country’ - a heartfelt and candid memoir charting his humble beginnings in rural Nova Scotia, the hard-won success he found under the bright lights of Nashville, Tennessee, and the life lessons learned on and off the road that ultimately led him home.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nAARON PRITCHETT\r\n\r\nHe’s has been a household name in Canadian Country music for 20 years, but when Aaron Pritchett hits the stage, he does so with the energy and intensity of an artist fresh on the scene. Yet despite being known for his dynamic, even raucous, live shows, it’s the classically country gentleman inside of Pritchett that’s made him a fan favourite - and staying force in Canadian country - for more than two decades.\r\n\r\nWith 13 Top Ten hits under hits under his belt [buckle], Pritchett has made a career of seamlessly moving from good ol’ boy anthems like “Hold My Beer” to pop-tinged party pleasers like “Worth a Shot” to heart-string pulling ballads like “Warm Safe Place”. He could have stopped when he had enough to fill a Greatest Hits album - which he did in 2015 - but instead he followed it up with several more including his 2019 #1 single, “Better When I Do”. Throughout it, Pritchett has racked up more than 30 Juno, CCMA, WCMA and BCCMA nominations including multiple wins for Entertainer of the Year, Male Vocalist of the Year and a CCMA SOCAN Songwriter of the Year award.\r\n\r\nWith his writing, Pritchett continues to push the boundaries of the country genre. And while he refuses to be pigeon-holed, staying grounded in his roots is one thing he insists on.\r\n\r\nA philanthropist at heart, in 2022 he launched his Annual Big Wheel Charity Golf Classic. The event has raised more than $150,000 to date for community-minded charities.\r\n\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndhX5RrO9bU"

        "@value": "Cape Breton’s Men of the Deeps chorus invite you to a Coal Miner’s Christmas\r\nperformance. Featuring selections from their brand-new 2025 Christmas\r\ncompilation, December Coal and their much-loved Christmas in the Mine album.\r\nThe jolly miners are excited to deliver two uplifting hours of songs and stories,\r\nbelly laughs and maybe even a step or two. You’ll hear new renditions of old\r\nsongs, original compositions never heard before and more! Make North America's\r\nonly coal miners' chorus part of your holiday season.\r\n\r\nABOUT THE MEN OF THE DEEPS - est. 1966\r\n\r\nFor nearly sixty years, Cape Breton’s Men of the Deeps choir have been travelling\r\nthe world as Canadian Ambassadors, singing and storytelling to give us a sense of\r\nwhat life was life for a miner and his family, in a mining town. Preserving our\r\nunique Cape Breton history, folklore, culture and talent.\r\nThe choir has toured throughout Canada and most of the United States, China and\r\nKosovo. They have been to the Northwest Territories and as far south as Arizona,\r\nAlabama, Florida and the Appalachian coal mining communities of Kentucky,\r\nVirginia and Pennsylvania. They have even performed in Las Vegas, Nevada.\r\nToday, the Men of the Deeps are so much more than just a singing group; they are\r\na social institution. The camaraderie amongst the members carries over to their\r\naudiences wherever they perform. Clad in authentic mining coveralls and hard\r\nhats, they make an impressive impact when they enter a concert hall in total\r\ndarkness using only the lamps on their helmets for light.\r\n\r\nAUDIENCE FEEDBACK\r\n“...the most amazing Christmas concert I have ever been to!”\r\n- Sandra M.\", Guysborough, N.S.\r\n\r\n“The men sing with so much passion, making every concert a heartfelt night of song\r\nand stories that is so enjoyable!” - Jean &amp; Dennis M., Sydney\r\n\r\n“Just bought and listened to “Christmas in the Mine” for the first time, it is Fantastic!\r\nThank-you.” - Daniel P. , Wainfleet, Ontario\r\n\r\n“I have never been to a concert when I was made to feel like it wasn’t a concert. It\r\nWAS a Cape Breton kitchen party... Thanks for the trip down home! “ - Deb W.,\r\nChatham, Ontario\r\n\r\n\"I was sitting in the balcony of the theatre with my aunt. We were singing, dancing, I\r\nlaughed, I cried...I have recommended this show to people and I will most definitely\r\nsee it again!” - Valerie L., North Bay, Ontario"

Featuring selections from their brand-new 2025 Christmas\ncompilation, December Coal and their much-loved Christmas in the Mine album.\nThe jolly miners are excited to deliver two uplifting hours of songs and stories,\nbelly laughs and maybe even a step or two. You’ll hear new renditions of old\nsongs, original compositions never heard before and more! Make North America’s\nonly coal miners’ chorus part of your holiday season.\nABOUT THE MEN OF THE DEEPS – est. 1966\nFor nearly sixty years, Cape Breton’s Men of the Deeps choir have been travelling\nthe world as Canadian Ambassadors, singing and storytelling to give us a sense of\nwhat life was life for a miner and his family, in a mining town. Preserving our\nunique Cape Breton history, folklore, culture and talent.\nThe choir has toured throughout Canada and most of the United States, China and\nKosovo. They have been to the Northwest Territories and as far south as Arizona,\nAlabama, Florida and the Appalachian coal mining communities of Kentucky,\nVirginia and Pennsylvania. They have even performed in Las Vegas, Nevada.\nToday, the Men of the Deeps are so much more than just a singing group; they are\na social institution. The camaraderie amongst the members carries over to their\naudiences wherever they perform. Clad in authentic mining coveralls and hard\nhats, they make an impressive impact when they enter a concert hall in total\ndarkness using only the lamps on their helmets for light.\nAUDIENCE FEEDBACK\n“…the most amazing Christmas concert I have ever been to!”\n– Sandra M.”, Guysborough, N.S.\n“The men sing with so much passion, making every concert a heartfelt night of song\nand stories that is so enjoyable!” – Jean & Dennis M., Sydney\n“Just bought and listened to “Christmas in the Mine” for the first time, it is Fantastic!\nThank-you.” – Daniel P. , Wainfleet, Ontario\n“I have never been to a concert when I was made to feel like it wasn’t a concert. It\nWAS a Cape Breton kitchen party… Thanks for the trip down home! “ – Deb W.,\nChatham, Ontario\n“I was sitting in the balcony of the theatre with my aunt. We were singing, dancing, I\nlaughed, I cried…I have recommended this show to people and I will most definitely\nsee it again!” – Valerie L., North Bay, Ontario\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tPerformer's Facebook Page\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMen of the Deeps - Coal Miner's Christmas on Facebook\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t"

Jill’s work has earned her awards, such as the Sirius XM Jazz Artist of the Year and the East Coast Music Award for Album of the Year, and scores of fans, including Blue Rodeo, Ron Sexsmith, and Kris Kristofferson, who called Jill “a real songwriter, and a damn good songwriter.”  Her evocative and timeless songs have been featured in film and TV, scoring shows such as Orange Is The New Black, The L Word, and Heartland, as well as powering a global advertising campaign for Chrysler with the track ‘Never Quit Loving You.’ \n\nAn unforgettable, enchanting performer, Jill has headlined iconic venues such as Toronto’s Massey Hall and Roy Thompson Hall, Ottawa’s National Arts Centre, Vancouver’s Vogue Theatre and Toykyo’s Blue Note and Cotton Club, and captivating audiences across the globe in Japan, Europe, Australia, Mexico, South America, the USA and the Middle East. \n\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tPerformer's Website Page\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tJill Barber  - Official Website\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t"

The concert touring in support of these projects has taken the group to theatre and festival stages coast to coast across Canada, had them jetting across America from festival stage to theatre stages and beyond, as well as sending them to Ireland and Scotland for prestigious events across the Atlantic.\r\n\r\nAs a group, the MacNeil siblings are widely regarded as one of the greatest live concert acts in the Celtic world. Hailing from Sydney Mines, Cape Breton Island, Nova Scotia, the family group is deeply rooted in Celtic music, culture, dance, language and history. Their numerous critically acclaimed recordings have included their own original songs as well as tried and true standards, both instrumental and vocal.\r\n\r\nThe Barra MacNeils live concert experience brings so much more to the stage than most live acts ever can. Multiple lead vocalists, beautiful sibling harmonies, top drawer instrumental prowess on a wide variety of acoustic, stringed, percussion and wind instruments blended with dancing, storytelling, Gaelic songs and a journey through an ancient culture; it is family entertainment at its highest level.\r\n\r\nSteeped in Cape Breton tradition with strong Celtic roots and musical artistry, this diverse and talented family group continues to wow audiences around the world with their captivating vocals, harmonies and extraordinary musicianship.\r\n\r\nMulti-award winners, the Barra MacNeils have released no less than 17 recordings  including: O Christmas Three (2013), The Celtic Colours Sessions (2012), Live in Concert with Symphony Nova Scotia (2012), In Concert (2009), In Session (2009), 20th Anniversary Collection (2007), Christmas Album II (2006), All At Once (2005), Racket In the Attic (2002), Christmas Album (1999), Until Now (1997), The Question(1995), The Traditional Album (1994), Closer to Paradise (1993 – Certified Gold in Canada), Timeframe (1990), Rock in the Stream (1989), The Barra MacNeils (1986). In 2001, they released a DVD titled Cape Breton Christmas incorporating music from their live Christmas Concert Special (as seen on television), plus a visit to Cape Breton, interviews with the Barra MacNeils home at Christmas and music videos.\r\n\r\nCanada’s Celtic ambassadors, the Barra MacNeils continue to perform to sold out audiences throughout Canada, the United States, the Caribbean, the United Kingdom and Europe. From headlining major festivals, concerts, special guest appearances (Rita MacNeils CTV Christmas Special, performing with The Chieftains) television specials, film and television placement (Men with Brooms Soundtrack; Racket In The Attic) and their annual Christmas tour, they have set the course with a solid foundation for success. The Barra MacNeils one-hour Christmas Television Special (2000) continues to be broadcast on Country Music Television (CMT) and on the Public Broadcasting Services (PBS) network in the United States. December 2007 saw the broadcast of a new Christmas Special which will no doubt also become part of the holiday season for years to come.\r\n\r\nThe Barra MacNeils continues to do what they love to do best, and that is playing their music for the fans. This incredibly talented family group tours Canada, the US and Europe to spread their distinctive brand of Celtic music worldwide."

        "@value": "She was born in the township of KwaZakhele in the Eastern Cape and raised by her single mother named Kwazibani (which means “Who Knows?” in Xhosa) while her father was serving a 21-year prison sentence. A domestic worker by day, Kwazibani was a “Sangoma” or “African medicine woman” with a natural gift for music. Nomfusi would accompany her mother to weekly Sangoma rituals known as “Intlombe,” where she soon developed a love for performing and crafted her artistic identity by dancing and singing for hours.\r\n\r\nTragically in 1998, Nomfusi was suddenly orphaned at age twelve when she lost her mother to HIV/AIDS. Nomfusi’s aunt took her and her siblings in, but sadly also succumbed to the same deadly disease three years later. Undeterred by the hand she was dealt at such a young age, Nomfusi turned her situation around to become one of South Africa's brightest, most recognizable stars. Never one for self-pity, Nomfusi strives to inspire others with her worldview that “life is about choices” and that \"one has to overcome the poverty of the mind first.” Her compassion has led her to doing outreach work at schools for at-risk youth in Soweto, Swaziland, and Malawi, and creating opportunities she didn’t have for the next generation. Additionally, she recently became an ambassador for MES, a Hillbrow-based NPO that helps homeless individuals get back on their feet and reintegrate into society.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;"

A domestic worker by day, Kwazibani was a “Sangoma” or “African medicine woman” with a natural gift for music. Nomfusi would accompany her mother to weekly Sangoma rituals known as “Intlombe,” where she soon developed a love for performing and crafted her artistic identity by dancing and singing for hours.\nTragically in 1998, Nomfusi was suddenly orphaned at age twelve when she lost her mother to HIV/AIDS. Nomfusi’s aunt took her and her siblings in, but sadly also succumbed to the same deadly disease three years later. Undeterred by the hand she was dealt at such a young age, Nomfusi turned her situation around to become one of South Africa’s brightest, most recognizable stars. Never one for self-pity, Nomfusi strives to inspire others with her worldview that “life is about choices” and that “one has to overcome the poverty of the mind first.” Her compassion has led her to doing outreach work at schools for at-risk youth in Soweto, Swaziland, and Malawi, and creating opportunities she didn’t have for the next generation. Additionally, she recently became an ambassador for MES, a Hillbrow-based NPO that helps homeless individuals get back on their feet and reintegrate into society.\n \n\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tPerformer's Website Page\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tNomfusi - Official Website\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t"

Tom is often called the godfather of the podcasting revolution, who inspired a generation of voices to find their platform.\n\n\nTom Green VIP Meet & Greet Add-On\n$62.50 // The VIP Meet & Greet will take place after the performance.

With Cameron sinkʷə Fraser-Monroe’s compelling taqəš, Alysa Pires’ striking Vestiges, and Guillaume Côté’s electrifying Le Carnaval des Animaux, this high-energy program from Canada’s leading dancemakers promises to please a wide range of spectators.\r\n\r\nCameron sinkʷə Fraser-Monroe brings his classical ballet training, knowledge of traditional Coast Salish, Grass, and Hoop Dance, and experience as a contemporary dancer to taqəš [tawKESH], which means “to return something” in Ayajuthem, the language belonging to the Homalco, Klahoose, K’omoks, and Tla’amin Nations. Set to several songs by Polaris Prize-winning composer and singer Jeremy Dutcher, taqəš follows the traditional story “Raven Returns the Water,” centred around ῤoho (raven) and walθ (frog). \r\n\r\nNext, award-winning choreographer Alysa Pires constructs a striking commentary on the search for true connection and meaning amid disorder. Set to the cinematic melodies of violinist Hilary Hahn and composer Hauschka, Vestiges highlights the virtuosity of Pires’ bold and lively choreography.\r\n\r\nRounding out the program, Guillaume Côté, recently retired Principal Dancer and Chorographic Associate with The National Ballet of Canada, applies his fresh, artistic vision to a jovial rendition of Camille Saint-Saëns’ Le Carnaval des Animaux, regarded as one of the French composer’s best-known works. Full of whimsical ornamentation, this upbeat ensemble piece pushes the limits of contemporary ballet and promises to delight audiences with its exuberant energy of frolicking and fun.\r\n\r\ntaqəš\r\nChoreography: Cameron sinkʷə Fraser-Monroe\r\nMusic: Jeremy Dutcher, Oqiton, Essuwonike, Ultestakon | Wolastoqiyik Lintuwakonawa\r\nLighting Design: Rylee Block after James Proudfoot\r\nCostume Concept: Cameron sinkʷə Fraser-Monroe\r\nDancers: TBD\r\n\r\n\r\nPause\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nVestiges\r\n\r\nChoreography: Alysa Pires\r\nMusic: Hilary Hahn and Hauschka\r\nLighting Design: Rylee Block\r\nCostume Concept: Alysa Pires\r\nCostume Couturier: Colleen Bryant | KOCO\r\nDancers: TBD\r\n\r\n\r\nIntermission\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nLe Carnaval des Animaux\r\n\r\nChoreography: Guillaume Côté\r\nMusic: Camille Saint-Saëns, Le Carnaval des animaux\r\nLighting Design: Rylee Block\r\nCostumes: TBD\r\nDancers: TBD\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nCAMERON sinkʷə FRASER-MONROE | Choreographer, taqəš \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCameron sinkʷə Fraser-Monroe is a member of the Tla’amin First Nation. At three years old he started Ukrainian dancing in Vernon, BC. He was privileged to receive several years of training and performance with World Champion hoop dancer Dallas Arcand and studied grass dance with Elder Mollie Bono. Since graduating from the Royal Winnipeg Ballet School on the RWB Alumni Scholarship, he has performed with many companies including Dancers of Damelahamid at Kia Mau Festival in New Zealand and the International Cervantino Festival, Jera Wolfe at Jacob’s Pillow Festival, Canada’s Royal Winnipeg Ballet at the National Arts Centre, the Atlantic Ballet Theatre of Canada, and Ballet Kelowna. \r\n\r\nAs a choreographer, Mr. Fraser-Monroe has received commissions from The National Ballet of Canada, Canada’s Royal Winnipeg Ballet, Fall for Dance Festival in NYC, Ballet Kelowna, the Winnipeg Summer Dance Collective, Whim W’Him Seattle, the Museum of Contemporary Art Toronto, Artist’s Climate Collective, Transformation Cabaret at the Cultch, and both PULSE and Indigenous Day Live! on APTN. He continues to practice and present hoop dance.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nALYSA PIRES | Choreographer, MAMBO\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAlysa Pires was born and raised on the traditional territory of the W̱SÁNEĆ people near Victoria, BC. She is an Honours BFA graduate of Toronto Metropolitan University and her choreographic works have been performed by companies such as The National Ballet of Canada, Alberta Ballet, Ballet Kelowna, Canada’s Ballet Jörgen, and Ballet Edmonton. Ms. Pires began working with the National Ballet of Canada as part of their Choreographic Workshop (2016-2018) where she created her critically acclaimed work In Between. She represented the company at the 13th International Competition for the Erik Bruhn Prize and was then appointed Choreographic Associate by Karen Kain, a position Ms. Pires held from 2019-2022. Ms. Pires recently became the first Canadian woman to create a work for New York City Ballet, making her Lincoln Center debut in May 2023 with Standard Deviation. \r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nGUILLAUME CÔTÉ | Choreographer, Le Carnaval des Animaux\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGuillaume Côté studied at Canada’s National Ballet School and joined The National Ballet of Canada in 1998. He quickly rose through the ranks and was promoted to Principal Dancer in 2004. In 2013, in addition to his position as a Principal Dancer, Mr. Côté assumed the role of Choreographic Associate with The National Ballet of Canada. Since then, eight of his pieces have entered the Company’s repertoire including, most recently, Being and Nothingness performed on an international tour to Russia. His first full-length ballet Le Petit Prince was presented by The National Ballet to sold-out houses in 2016. In 2018, Mr. Côté created in collaboration with the famed Director Robert Lepage, Frame by Frame, a new full-length evening. Mr. Côté is also the Artistic Director of the Festival des Arts de Saint-Sauveur, one of the largest summer dance festivals in the country."

With Cameron sinkʷə Fraser-Monroe’s compelling taqəš, Alysa Pires’ striking Vestiges, and Guillaume Côté’s electrifying Le Carnaval des Animaux, this high-energy program from Canada’s leading dancemakers promises to please a wide range of spectators.\nCameron sinkʷə Fraser-Monroe brings his classical ballet training, knowledge of traditional Coast Salish, Grass, and Hoop Dance, and experience as a contemporary dancer to taqəš [tawKESH], which means “to return something” in Ayajuthem, the language belonging to the Homalco, Klahoose, K’omoks, and Tla’amin Nations. Set to several songs by Polaris Prize-winning composer and singer Jeremy Dutcher, taqəš follows the traditional story “Raven Returns the Water,” centred around ῤoho (raven) and walθ (frog). \nNext, award-winning choreographer Alysa Pires constructs a striking commentary on the search for true connection and meaning amid disorder. Set to the cinematic melodies of violinist Hilary Hahn and composer Hauschka, Vestiges highlights the virtuosity of Pires’ bold and lively choreography.\nRounding out the program, Guillaume Côté, recently retired Principal Dancer and Chorographic Associate with The National Ballet of Canada, applies his fresh, artistic vision to a jovial rendition of Camille Saint-Saëns’ Le Carnaval des Animaux, regarded as one of the French composer’s best-known works. Full of whimsical ornamentation, this upbeat ensemble piece pushes the limits of contemporary ballet and promises to delight audiences with its exuberant energy of frolicking and fun.\ntaqəš\nChoreography: Cameron sinkʷə Fraser-Monroe\nMusic: Jeremy Dutcher, Oqiton, Essuwonike, Ultestakon | Wolastoqiyik Lintuwakonawa\nLighting Design: Rylee Block after James Proudfoot\nCostume Concept: Cameron sinkʷə Fraser-Monroe\nDancers: TBD\n\nPause\n \nVestiges\nChoreography: Alysa Pires\nMusic: Hilary Hahn and Hauschka\nLighting Design: Rylee Block\nCostume Concept: Alysa Pires\nCostume Couturier: Colleen Bryant | KOCO\nDancers: TBD\n\nIntermission\n \nLe Carnaval des Animaux\nChoreography: Guillaume Côté\nMusic: Camille Saint-Saëns, Le Carnaval des animaux\nLighting Design: Rylee Block\nCostumes: TBD\nDancers: TBD\n \nCAMERON sinkʷə FRASER-MONROE | Choreographer, taqəš \n\nCameron sinkʷə Fraser-Monroe is a member of the Tla’amin First Nation. At three years old he started Ukrainian dancing in Vernon, BC. He was privileged to receive several years of training and performance with World Champion hoop dancer Dallas Arcand and studied grass dance with Elder Mollie Bono. Since graduating from the Royal Winnipeg Ballet School on the RWB Alumni Scholarship, he has performed with many companies including Dancers of Damelahamid at Kia Mau Festival in New Zealand and the International Cervantino Festival, Jera Wolfe at Jacob’s Pillow Festival, Canada’s Royal Winnipeg Ballet at the National Arts Centre, the Atlantic Ballet Theatre of Canada, and Ballet Kelowna. \nAs a choreographer, Mr. Fraser-Monroe has received commissions from The National Ballet of Canada, Canada’s Royal Winnipeg Ballet, Fall for Dance Festival in NYC, Ballet Kelowna, the Winnipeg Summer Dance Collective, Whim W’Him Seattle, the Museum of Contemporary Art Toronto, Artist’s Climate Collective, Transformation Cabaret at the Cultch, and both PULSE and Indigenous Day Live! on APTN. He continues to practice and present hoop dance.\n \nALYSA PIRES | Choreographer, MAMBO\n\nAlysa Pires was born and raised on the traditional territory of the W̱SÁNEĆ people near Victoria, BC. She is an Honours BFA graduate of Toronto Metropolitan University and her choreographic works have been performed by companies such as The National Ballet of Canada, Alberta Ballet, Ballet Kelowna, Canada’s Ballet Jörgen, and Ballet Edmonton. Ms. Pires began working with the National Ballet of Canada as part of their Choreographic Workshop (2016-2018) where she created her critically acclaimed work In Between. She represented the company at the 13th International Competition for the Erik Bruhn Prize and was then appointed Choreographic Associate by Karen Kain, a position Ms. Pires held from 2019-2022. Ms. Pires recently became the first Canadian woman to create a work for New York City Ballet, making her Lincoln Center debut in May 2023 with Standard Deviation. \n \nGUILLAUME CÔTÉ | Choreographer, Le Carnaval des Animaux\n\nGuillaume Côté studied at Canada’s National Ballet School and joined The National Ballet of Canada in 1998. He quickly rose through the ranks and was promoted to Principal Dancer in 2004. In 2013, in addition to his position as a Principal Dancer, Mr. Côté assumed the role of Choreographic Associate with The National Ballet of Canada. Since then, eight of his pieces have entered the Company’s repertoire including, most recently, Being and Nothingness performed on an international tour to Russia. His first full-length ballet Le Petit Prince was presented by The National Ballet to sold-out houses in 2016. In 2018, Mr. Côté created in collaboration with the famed Director Robert Lepage, Frame by Frame, a new full-length evening. Mr. Côté is also the Artistic Director of the Festival des Arts de Saint-Sauveur, one of the largest summer dance festivals in the country. \n\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tPerformer's Website Page\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBallet Kelowna: taqəš and Other Works - Official Website\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t"
