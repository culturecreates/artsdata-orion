        "@value": "Maryna Krut (pronounced “kroot”) is a Ukrainian singer and virtuoso of the bandura, a stringed instrument unique to Ukraine that looks and sounds like a hybrid of a lute and a harp. At 28 years old, KRUT is a self-assured performing artist; her compelling, soulful performances evoke both folk traditions and modern sensibilities, with pop and jazz flourishes. A Eurovision finalist, she often represents Ukraine at official events and performs for soldiers in the current war zone, and has appeared at the Edinburgh International Culture Summit, Andalucia Big Festival, Montreal Ukrainian Festival, and on other international stages. The bandura’s harpsichord-like sound is both delicate and assertive. KRUT’s instrument has an astonishing 64 strings stretched over a single piece of wood, with 13 bass strings stretched along a short, fretless neck, and the remaining treble strings stretched across a large soundboard. She plays the bass set with her left hand, while the right plays across the prodigious treble array. In addition to being a masterful instrumentalist, KRUT’s striking, powerful voice soars in an acoustic setting. Early bandurists were male balladeers who travelled from village to village; early in her career, says KRUT, “I dyed my hair pink, painted my nails black, wore leather jackets and started to play the bandura in a more modern, jazzy and funky way” (Vogue Australia). Now she’s stretching her style back toward the bandura’s folk roots. “[Her music] represents the DNA of Ukrainian culture, in all its styles, classic and very modern” (Ouest France).TD ConnectsDesigned in partnership with TD Bank, TD CONNECTS is a series of exciting performances that amplifies diverse voices in the arts and builds stronger connections in our communities.Each TD Connects performance features a local nonprofit group who is invited to introduce themselves to our audience onstage before the show. TD Connects performances spotlight underrepresented artists in the arts and shine a light on the great work being done by our fellow nonprofit organizations. "

Whether it’s a violin concerto, a magical dancing sheet of music or impossibly suspending various instruments on stage, his show is in a league of its own.

        "@value": "Sleeping Beauty is one of the world‘s most famous classical ballets and holds a place in the repertoire of virtually every major company. Canada‘s Ballet Jörgen created its own unique classical ballet rendition of this predominant work which premiered during the 2015-2016 season. This major ballet tells the enchanting story of Aurora and her prince complete with its inherently magical qualities and dazzling choreography.This fairy tale about a young woman placed under a spell to sleep for a hundred years only to be awakened by a kiss is an easily accessible story. It appeals to a child’s imagination and also holds a special place in the hearts of adults. The underlying theme is the tug between the forces of good (the Lilac Fairy) and evil (Carabosse), serving as an important thread to the plot. Told in three acts, the ballet benefits from the character development and technical expertise for which Canada’s Ballet Jörgen is known.Artistic Director and award-winning choreographer Bengt Jörgen focuses on the magical elements and the interpretation of the ballet as a nature allegory: The young woman represents nature, the wicked fairy is winter, who deadens life with pricks of frost until a young man, spring, cuts away the brambles to allow the sun to awaken sleeping nature. Sleeping Beauty by Canada’s Ballet Jörgen draws on the traditional choreography by Marius Petipa to spin a tale of nature and love that will inspire young and old alike.The delightful story is danced to the original 1890 score by Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky, set to a libretto based on Charles Perrault’s story La Belle au bois dormant. Audiences can look forward to stunning costumes and captivating lighting design, and are guaranteed to provide an evening of entertaining and inspiring live performance.PAY IT FORWARD*When purchasing tickets to these shows, in addition to regular priced tickets, you will have the following 2 options:-The Supported rate is for those with lesser means and who don’t have the same opportunity to attend professional performances at regular prices (Students, unemployed, underwaged…).-The Supporter rate is for those who wish to pay it forward and help someone in need attend the show.We hope this inclusion initiative will increase access to the Capitol Theatre so that more people in our community can LOVE IT LIVE!*Limited quantities "

And with jokes ranging from false eyelashes to oil changes, she’s just as capable of making a hairdresser laugh as a mechanic from Val d’Or.After making her mark on Le prochain stand-up, where she reached the finals, Mona de Grenoble received a nomination at the 2022 Gala Les Olivier for the podcast Entre 2 lèvres, which she co-hosted.
