Both first experienced the thrill of performance as part of a musical family. Friesen grew up in Edmonton and Saskatoon, while Roberts grew up in Winnipeg. As the Prairie Sons, the two are dedicated to innovative programming and unforgettably engaging performances.\nPerhaps it is the sense of space, the living skies and the clear view to the edge of the horizon that breeds artistry in those who live in the Canadian West. \nAs the Prairie Sons, cellist David Liam Roberts and pianist Godwin Friesen embody the expansive, nuanced perspective of their home landscape in their concert program. The two award-winning musicians met at the Royal Conservatory’s Glenn Gould School of Music, and recognized a kindred spirit in each other. Both hail from the Prairies, began performing alongside other members of their families, and have been named to CBC’s list of Hot 30 Classical Musicians Under 30.\nThe energy and innovation of the Prairie Sons invites you to take a fresh look at a familiar landscape, and to witness the miracle in the everyday.\n*Single tickets on sale August 1, 2024\n\nSee our full Season 94 lineup and subscribe today!\nFind out what’s happening with your Orchestra! \nSupport your orchestra by donating today!\n \nWhat’s Next\n\nSunday Chamber2:00PM, Sunday, November 3, 2024FREE EVENT2:00PM, Sunday, May 11, 2025FREE EVENTAn Evening of Pink Floyd7:30PM, Saturday, November 16, 2024Save Your SeatsElf7:30PM, Saturday, December 7, 2024Save your SeatsHandel's Messiah7:30PM, Friday, December 13, 2024Save your SeatsSing-Along Messiah2:00PM, Saturday, December 14, 2024Save Your SeatsThe Medium7:30PM, Friday, January 17, 2025Save your Seats7:30PM, Saturday, January 18, 2025Save your SeatsOnce Upon A Time7:30PM, Saturday, January 25, 2025Save your SeatsSleeping Beauty7:30PM, Saturday, February 15, 2025Save your Seats\n\n\n\nShare this:TwitterPrintFacebookEmail\t\t"
