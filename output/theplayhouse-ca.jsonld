The fly tower and box office were added at this time and the auditorium size was reduced to a capacity of 763 seats.\n\nIn 2000, the facility came under the ownership and management of Fredericton Playhouse Inc. - a charitable non-profit corporation associated with the City of Fredericton.\n\nToday, the theatre operates as a professional performance venue available for local, national, and international artists and companies. The organization also presents touring artists as part of its own professional series and offers various other specialized programs for youth and local artists.\n\nThe auditorium currently seats 709 people (473 orchestra, 236 balcony) and is equipped with a listening assist system and several wheelchair and transfer seats to accommodate all patrons. \n\nIts stage features modern sound, lighting, video, and fly systems and is the best equipped purpose-built theatre in the capital region. A large rehearsal hall is located on the second level. A spacious greenroom and purpose-built dressing rooms are also made available for visiting artists.\n\nThe facility’s lobbies provide a gallery space for local visual artists. A cloak room, bar/concessions and merchandise services are available during events along with access to the Fredericton Convention Centre for additional banks of restrooms and access to the East End Parking Garage. Professional ticketing services are provided by a box office that is open daily to the public."

        "@value": "At the Fredericton Playhouse, we’re always looking for new ways to make the performing arts more accessible and to encourage our community to take a chance on new and exciting work. This season, we have SIX shows offering Pay What You Will tickets, in addition to our three Kidstage performances. There’s something new for everyone to discover. Read on for more information!\n\nHow it works\n\nStep 1: Reserve your ticket\n\nJust like attending any other show at the Fredericton Playhouse, you need to reserve a ticket. You can reserve them online HERE, in person or over the phone. If you’re unable to attend the show (life happens!), please let our Box Office know as soon as possible so that we can provide this opportunity to other members of the community.\n\nStep 2: Sit back and enjoy\n\nWhen you get to the theatre on show day (don’t forget your tickets!), our ushers will provide you with an empty envelope. Sit back and enjoy the performance.\n\nStep 3: Pay What You Will\n\nOnce the show is over, you decide your price of admission based on your experience. You can pay using your envelope with cash, credit card or by cheque.\n\nThe shows\n\nPerson of Interest: Melody Johnson\n\nEverybody knows there are good neighbours, and there are bad neighbours…This is the story of the latter. Person of Interest is the tale of a good, law-abiding citizen who hoped to volunteer in her community and so applied for a police background check. It was at that point when she discovered she had a record and was considered a Person of Interest – courtesy of some bad neighbours next door! It was their final act of retaliation.\n\nWritten and performed by Canadian comedian Melody Johnson, Person of Interest is a one-woman show based on true events (with comedic embellishments) that will have you thanking your lucky stars if you have decent neighbours!\n\nChristine Tassan et les Imposteures\n\nWith a decade and a half of bringing their special blend of Gypsy jazz and revisited cover songs to stage, Christine Tassan et les Imposteures have made a name for themselves on the music scene. In their latest show, these four exquisitely talented musicians bring together some of the best works by Django Reinhardt, Félix Leclerc, and American swing composers.\n\nWith a singular mix of virtuosity, daring and humour, the string band draws inspiration from one artist’s poetry and the other’s swing to weave a rich new musical universe. They’ve expanded their concept to the wonderful swing music of some contemporary “friends” of Django and Félix — revisiting hit songs created by George Gershwin, Louis Prima or Charlie Chaplin and blend them nicely with Django’s beautiful melodies.\n\nDuffleBag: Robin Hood\n\nThis holiday season, DuffleBag Theatre brings the classic story of Robin Hood to life, with plenty of hilarious twists along the way! DuffleBag’s fractured fairy tales are an annual favourite, full of spontaneous and amusing audience involvement. With all the humour and fun you have come to expect, DuffleBag hits the mark with this on-target tale of derring-do!\n\nSuitable for all ages.\n\nRUBBERBAND: Vic’s Mix\n\nRUBBERBAND dance company expertly blends urban and contemporary dance, while including theatricality and highly athletic segments. Vic’s Mix is a highlight reel of artistic director/choreographer Victor Quijada’s repertoire. In this remix of his own work, Quijada goes further in his experiments defying notions of theatricality and audience expectations, orchestrating the clash between urban pop and classical composition. These dancers are sure to astound in this creative and athletic dance collection.\n\nL’aubergine’s Ripopée\n\nL’Aubergine is the oldest clowning company in Quebec to produce shows for young audiences, and has carved out a special niche by nurturing a unique artistic vision. In this clownesque fable about the strength of friendship, four artists fall asleep in a theatre waiting for their guests. To their surprise, the audience is already there when they wake up! The show begins, but things get all mixed up. Day-to-day life interferes with the performance and forces it down a new, unpredictable path.\n\nSuitable for ages 5- 12.\n\nNaghash Ensemble\n\nThe Naghash Ensemble combines the earthy spirituality of Armenian folk song, new classical music, contemporary post-minimalism and the energy of rock and jazz. Three brilliant female vocalists and some of Armenia’s finest instrumentalists on duduk, oud, dhol and piano play new music based on sacred texts by the medieval Armenian mystic poet and priest, Mkrtich Naghash. Part folk music, part classical, this show is profoundly moving.\n\nRaine Hamilton String Trio\n\nResonant, acoustic chamber folk with an otherworldly edge, and a lyric presence that cuts deep. Sounds like: a string quartet + Sarah Harmer + Joni Mitchell.\n\nRaine is part prairie songstress, part story-weaver; each song has a story delivered with her signature humour and grace. A classical violinist and musicologist by training, Raine and her string trio offer a refreshing taste of chamber-folk with arrangements that push and pull, that move as they console.\n\nAxis Theatre’s production of SOMEBODY LOVES YOU MR. HATCH\n\nSee the popular children’s book come to life on stage! Mr. Hatch leads a predictable and dreary life; he keeps to himself. One Valentine’s Day, he unexpectedly receives a heart-shaped package with an anonymous note that whispers, “somebody loves you,” and everything changes. This heartwarming puppet play examines the effect that kindness can have on a lonely existence. Join washerwomen Betsy, Edna, and Molly as they bring Mr. Hatch’s story to life and help him search for his secret admirer!\n\nSuitable for ages 4- 10.\n\nBeverly Glenn-Copeland with Indigo Rising\n\nBeverly Glenn-Copeland, born into a family all of whom were very musical, essentially studied the classical piano repertoire from ‘cradlehood,’ listening to his father playing the piano four to five hours a day. He went on to study classical music at McGill, and then after a few years of concertizing – singing the European song repertoire – he suddenly felt called to write music that would weave all the different musical cultures he had come to love.\n\nWhy Pay What You Will?\n\nWe’re champions of the philosophy that the arts should be an integral part of our lives, and that the Playhouse should be accessible to everyone in the community. We’re hopeful that programs like Pay What You Will can help to reduce financial barriers and make it possible for more people in our community to experience the magic of live performance.\n\nWe believe strongly in the quality of artists we bring to our stage as part of our Spotlight and Kidstage Series and we want you to take a chance on a show that you might not be familiar with. Try something new and pay the ticket price you feel reflects the performance without extending beyond your budget.\n\nMore information\n\nAny questions? Our Box Office staff would be happy to chat with you. You can reach them at boxoffice@theplayhouse.ca or by phone at 458-8344.\n"

        "@value": "With the return of in-person events, and in time for Black History Month, the Fredericton Playhouse is proud to present Haitian-Canadian musician Wesli on February 18 in partnership with local African Heritage Month organizers\n\nBorn in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, Wesli has been playing music since he was just eight years old. Coming from a family of 8 children where music was a daily food for the soul, Wesli used his talent as a unique way to get out of the surrounding ghetto, starting in the gospel choir of his local church. \n\nNow based in Montreal, Wesli brings together a wide range of talents for his music. Be it acoustic or with his big band, he unites Haitian voodoo and rara styles with roots, Afrobeat, and hip-hop styles.\n\n“We are excited to be showcasing Wesli at the Fredericton Playhouse for the first time,” says Saa Andrew Gbongbor, local African Heritage Month organizer. “This month, as we celebrate Black History in New Brunswick, the Fredericton Playhouse has partnered with Black-led organizations, the New Brunswick African Association, BOTA-NB and le Centre Communautaire Ste-Anne to bring you one of the best of Can-Afro-Caribbean artists working today.”\n\nOn February 19, at 1 pm, Wesli & his team will also lead a dance and drumming workshop for community members of all ages. The workshop will be offered virtually and in-person at the Fredericton Cultural Centre. This event is free, and everyone is welcome. \n\nTickets for Wesli are available at the Playhouse Box Office in person, or by calling 506-458-8344. For more information on the performance or workshop, visit www.theplayhouse.ca.\n\nWesli is presented in partnership with New Brunswick African Association and the Centre Communautaire Ste-Anne. The Spotlight Series is generously supported by media partner CBC New Brunswick and season partners Downtown Fredericton and Crowne Plaza Lord Beaverbrook Hotel. \n\n--30--\n"

        "@value": "In 2021-22 season, the Fredericton Playhouse continued its InterMISSION Artist Residency program, hosting 21 artists in four different residencies. \n\nSydney Hallett\n\nDance and choreographer Sydney Hallett created and performed in an otherworldly solo dance film shot by Strike Pictures (Lance Kennth Blakney, Gordon Mihan and Arianna Martinez) which was premiered digitally on April 29, 2022 - International Dance Day (watch it here). “I am so grateful and proud to present The River Dreams Dance Film, a piece that allowed me to explore, play, and act as a conduit for Beverly Glenn-Copeland’s deeply nuanced, intricate, transcendent, and truly sublime music. My hope for this film is that it captures those qualities visually, and transports viewers into the other worldly experience that is ‘River Dreams” – Sydney Hallett. \n\n\n\n  \n  \n      \n  \n    \n      Image    \n                    \n\n\n\n              \n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n \n\nNatalie Sappier\n\nWolastoqiyik Indigenous artist Natalie Sappier and her collaborators were in residence for the ‘Stories of Maw’ project. “Stories of Maw, carries stories of not only myself but my people. It is important for that I carry these stories in a sacred way. I am unable to create these stories without my community circle. Part of the process of creating these stories is activating creative spaces is creating sacred space and beginning each day with ceremony and having discussions about what stories stay within our community and what is okay to share outside community. Stories for me is healing medicine.  It is exciting to share the stories on stage. But these stories deserve patient, knowing and understanding and I want to make sure it shared in an honourable way which is why I am not rushing into production and I am focused on the gathering and discussions that need to happen before anything else.” - Samaqani Cocahq\n\n\n  \n      \n  \n    \n      Image    \n                    \n\n\n\n              \n\n  \n\n\n \n\nElm City String Quartet\n\nThe Elm City String Quartet and Richard Hornsby used their residency as an opportunity to collaborate on hidden gems of the clarinet and string repertoire.  The pieces performed highlight the influence of the landscapes in which the composers were working.   The residency was used for rehearsal sessions to find the right approach to make each piece come to life.  Watch the video clip here. \n\n “We were so happy to be able to have the time on the stage and have access to the expertise of the Playhouse staff and the resources to video the show. It allowed us to be innovative – recording ‘in the round’ so as to project a more intimate and personal view of the concert to the on-line audience. This adaptation to presenting in a new way would not have been possible without the Playhouse and its desire to keep the arts alive, during difficult presenting times.”- Richard Hornsby\n\n\n  \n      \n  \n    \n      Image    \n                    \n\n\n\n              \n\n  \n\n\n \n\nLaura Forrester \n\nVisual artist Laura Forrestor set up in a theatre seat armed with her drawing tools and worked on sketches of two physically inspired evenings by Ballet Kelowna and Niki & JD’s ‘Knot’. \"This residency gave me a rare opportunity to get out of my studio and change my visual and creative perspective. It gave me the chance to elaborate on a non-representational expression style and work from live sketches that were created in real time. This residency helped coax me further out of my creative comfort zone and was a very rewarding challenge!\" – Laura.  \n"

        "@value": "Hot off the tail of the previous season, the Fredericton Playhouse has announced the lineup for the upcoming 2022-23 Spotlight series. This season features 28 professional performances in music, theatre, circus, comedy and dance from across Canada and around the world. \n\nIn addition to a full Spotlight Series, the Fredericton Playhouse has four scheduled performances as part of the Kidstage Series – including one show offering both French and English performances – and even more “Pay What You Will” shows than last year. There is truly something for everyone in Fredericton to experience this year at the Playhouse!\n\nMusic\n\nMaureen Batt & Greg Harrison: Lighthouse – A visually and sonically rich immersive experience that touches on themes of loss, love, and hope, weaving classical, electronic, and pop genres. This album was created from letters and journals written on a journey through grief. \n\nRon Sexsmith – Canada’s foremost, well-heeled singer-songwriter found domestic bliss outside of Toronto, inspiring his latest album, Hermitage. “I think it's a very upbeat album, lyrically,” he confirms. “It’s reflective of the sort of peacefulness that I'd recently felt. I'm getting more comfortable in my own skin.”\n\nSilver Wolf Band – Lively, engaging, and self-assured lyrical performance is what makes this four-piece Indigenous folk-rock band one of the most in-demand music groups from Labrador. Lyrically, their songs are shaped and informed by family, community, love, and their homeland itself.\n\nDebussy Quartet – The Debussy Quartet has established its reputation as one of the finest quartets touring and recording today. They perform a wide range of works and are perhaps most well known for their devotion to the French repertoire.\n\nDracula (1931) featuring members of Symphony NB and Resonance New Music - NB composer Andrew Reed Miller has created this original music to be performed by core members of Symphony NB, along with a screening of the 1931 classic film, Dracula.\n\nClassified – One of Canada’s most respected and successful rap artists and producers will finally bring a new style of show to the stage. Classified’s acoustic show is more personal and intimate, letting the audience hear the stories behind the songs, and experience the music in a new way.\n\nMichael Kaeshammer – Flavours of jazz, boogie-woogie and blues combined with passion and meticulous detail, Michael Kaeshammer is unafraid of crossing genre boundaries and uses his many influences to take the listener along on a memorable journey.\n\nErin Costelo – Award-winning, Nova Scotia artist and producer, Erin Costelo presents one of the most beloved albums in history, Carole King's Tapestry. In addition to this album, Erin will showcase her album We Can Get Over in an opening set.\n\nThe Last Waltz NB – New Brunswick pays tribute to one of the greatest concerts of all time!

Crossing the globe, commanding both festival and theatre stages, they are seasoned performers, singer-songwriters, and storytellers on their own and together.\n\nClassic Albums Live\n\nA perennial Playhouse favourite, Classic Albums Live presents skilled musicians who recreate the greatest albums of the ‘60s and ‘70s live on stage — note for note, cut for cut. Don’t look for costumes and lookalike theatrics at these rock recitals, just pure musicianship and songs that shaped a generation. \n\nThis season, Classic Albums Live presents Billy Joel: The Stranger, and The Beatles: Let It Be. \n\nTheatre & Comedy\n\nPearle Harbour: Agit-Pop! - Drag “tragicomedienne” Pearle Harbour’s Agit-Pop! is a collection of her heart-wrenchingly hilarious short acts told with her signature acid-wit.\n\nHyprov – Canada’s master improviser, Colin Mochrie, teams up with hypnotist Asad Mecci for improv under hypnosis! Audience members volunteer to be hypnotised by Mecci, then remain on stage to participate in an improv scene with Mochrie – would you do it?\n\nOld Stock: A Refugee Love Story – A humourously dark folktale woven together with a high-energy concert. This Klezmer-folk music-theatre hybrid starring genre-bending sensation Ben Caplan is inspired by the true stories of two Jewish Romanian refugees coming to Canada in 1908.\n\nBetween Breaths – Between Breaths is a one-act play telling the true story of Dr. Jon Lien, well-known in Newfoundland as the Whale Man. Lien pioneered techniques for rescuing whales trapped in fishing nets.\n\nOVERLAP - Both a love letter and an uncompromising critique of the city of Moncton, OVERLAP is author Céleste Godinʼs first full-length play. Created in a language that is at once personal, dense with insight, and bursting with humanity; performed in Chiac (with English surtitles).\n\nDance\n\nRUBBERBAND: Vic's Mix– This Montreal-based dance company expertly blends contemporary and urban dance with theatricality and highly athletic segments.\n\nSocial Tango Project – Tango, a social dance, enables people of different ages, cultures, and backgrounds to meet in an “embrace.” Be it the music, the beauty, or the sense of connection, tango has won the hearts of dancers around the world.\n\nAtlantic Ballet of Canada presents the world premiere of Pisuwin - From award-winning director and choreographer Igor Dobrovolskiy, and multi-disciplinary artist Nipahtuwet Naka Wespahtuwet (Possesom) Paul (Wolastoqiyik, Sitansisk First Nation), Pisuwin is an epic first ever Wolastoq story-ballet set to the soaring music of Polaris Prize and Juno award-winning composer Jeremy Dutcher (Wolastoqiyik, Neqotkuk First Nation).\n\nCircus \n\nKalabanté – The Afrique En Cirque show symbolizes the strength, agility and joy of life found in African youth.

        "@value": "The Fredericton Playhouse selection committee has recognized and awarded dance teacher and choreographer Sarah Clarke-Rowinski as the Playhouse Honours recipient for 2022. \n\n“Dance is a special type of artistic expression, combining the physical and emotional,” says Murray Jamer, President of the Board of the Fredericton Playhouse. “Sarah has brought this joy to many young dancers in our community throughout the years. We are so pleased to present the Playhouse Honours this year to someone who has worked so hard bringing the arts into the lives of dancers in Fredericton.”\n\nSarah is an award-winning dancer and choreographer who has contributed substantially to the growth of young dancers in Fredericton and the performing arts community since coming to New Brunswick in 1998. Originally from Nova Scotia, Sarah began dancing at a young age with the Royal Academy of Dance in Ontario before moving to British Columbia where she continued her extensive dance training. At 15 she accepted an invitation to train with the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater in New York City. The experience has had lasting impact on her as an artist and has played a central role in her work with youth. \n\nIn 2004 Sarah founded X-treme Dance Studio offering new approaches, opportunities, and styles for competitive and non-competitive aspiring young dancers. Nearly a decade and half later, Sarah has won numerous awards as an entrepreneur and teacher and has dedicated herself to helping young dancers find career pathways in the performing arts, and hundreds more simply find a love for dance. \n\nOver the years, Sarah’s expertise has made important contributions to many performing arts organizations within the Fredericton community. In addition to being an instructor at St. Thomas University and the University of New Brunswick, she has volunteered countless hours in public schools helping with a variety of programs aimed at enhancing movement education with students and teachers alike. \n\nInstilling in her dancers the importance of volunteerism, X-treme Dance Studio dancers regularly give back to the community performing in important events, senior centers, and televised telethons. Most importantly, Sarah has become well known by families and dancers as an incredibly important role model for children and young adults. For the past 18 years, Sarah’s ability to nurture a space of care, inclusiveness, and belonging for dancers in the performing arts is perhaps her most important legacy.\n\n“As a parent I have watched my two girls, and many other students develop into better students and people because of the influence from dance in their lives,” says Lise Julian, whose children danced for Sarah. “My girls have improved mentally and physically, have a great sense of self discipline and respect for themselves and others.”\n\nAs the recipient of the 2022 Playhouse Honours, Sarah Clarke-Rowinski will join fifteen other local performing arts pioneers bestowed this prestigious award over the years. \n\nThe Fredericton Playhouse acknowledges generous support from promotional partner Atlantic Mediaworks for their contribution of services to the program.\n"

We’re hopeful that programs like Pay What You Will can help to reduce financial barriers and make it possible for more people in our community to experience the magic of live performance.\n\nWe believe strongly in the quality of artists we bring to our stage as part of our Spotlight and Kidstage Series and we want you to take a chance on a show that you might not be familiar with. Try something new and pay the ticket price you feel reflects the performance without extending beyond your budget. \n\nHow it works\n\nStep 1: Reserve your ticket\n\nJust like attending any other show at the Fredericton Playhouse, you need to reserve a ticket. You can reserve them online HERE, in person or over the phone. If you’re unable to attend the show (life happens!), please let our Box Office know as soon as possible so that we can provide this opportunity to other members of the community.\n\nStep 2: Sit back and enjoy\n\nWhen you get to the theatre on show day (don’t forget your tickets!), our ushers will provide you with an empty envelope. Sit back and enjoy the performance.\n\nStep 3: Pay What You Will\n\nOnce the show is over, you decide your price of admission based on your experience. You can pay using your envelope with cash, credit card or by cheque.\n\nTo see the full listing of shows, click HERE, and look for \"Pay What You Will\" listed as the ticket price. \n"

Otherwise, we will be happy to exchange your tickets for an account balance (less $4*) prior to the performance in the event that you are unable to attend (this must take place at least 2 hours before the performance). We cannot exchange tickets for a performance which has already taken place.\n\nChildren under two (2) years old ARE PERMITTED to attend at no cost if they are to be seated on the lap of another patron and therefore do not require their own seat.\n\nChildren two (2) years old and over REQUIRE A TICKET and seating assignment, even if they will not be using their seat (sitting on the lap of another patron). \n\nFor a complete copy of the policy, please contact our Box Office at 506-458-8344 or our Patron Services Manager at 506-459-6217.\n\n*All fees and service charges subject to 15% HST."

Annually, more than 100 of their students perform in the Fredericton Music Festival and many win first places, medals and prizes. Several of their students have continued with advanced musical education and are working toward careers as professional performing musicians or music teachers.\n\nWith more than 70 years of combined teaching experience, the Tislers have literally taught, coached and directed hundreds of students in Fredericton.

She taught her first handful of students in the 1960s, and as her class sizes began to increase, she traveled abroad to further train and build upon her dance repertoire. By the 1980s Kilburn was in demand for lessons all over the region, and she began sending her top students to teach classes at satellite studios to fill demand.\n\nBonnie Kilburn has nourished generations of young people hungry for a creative outlet. The children and adults that join her school develop a lot more than just dance; they also develop self confidence, leadership skills and a long list of those they can call a friend. 2013 marks the 40th anniversary of her Dance Spectacular at The Fredericton Playhouse."

Button-activated automatic doors lead into the lobby and box office area. \n\nWashrooms\n\nWashrooms are wheelchair accessible with specifically assigned stalls in both men’s and women’s washrooms.\n\nTheatre Experience \n\nThere are several removable seats in the auditorium floor specifically designed to meet the needs of patrons in wheelchairs; the entrance and aisles into the auditorium (floor-level) are ramped. In addition, we also have transfer seats that make it easier for patrons in wheelchairs to transfer to the fixed theatre seating if preferred – please be sure to let the box office staff know at the time of ordering if you require a wheelchair or transfer seat during a performance. While tickets may be booked online, if a transfer or wheelchair-specific seat is required, please call or visit the box office in person to book these tickets.\n\nThe Playhouse is also fully equipped with an Assistive Listening System throughout the auditorium for persons hard of hearing. These can be found at the Coat Check in the main lobby and are available upon request.\n\nThe theatre doors are typically open 30 minutes before a performance begins; if you need any additional assistance, please ask a volunteer usher when you arrive. "

At only 23 years old, the Nova Scotian musician has created a name for himself with his unique take on traditional East Coast fiddle music, which he and his collaborator Keith Mullins have dubbed “Mi’kmaltic.” A blend of Mi’kmaq + Celtic, Toney fuses cultural heritages, drawing from old songs of the Mi’kmaq, some dating back 500 years.\n\n--\n\nSaltwater Songs - Thursday, April 11 \n\n\n  \n      \n  \n    \n      Image    \n                    \n\n\n\n              \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\nWith Saltwater Songs, Catherine MacLellan, Rachel Beck, and Cassie & Maggie are joining forces to present a brand new songwriters’ circle. These three East Coast acts will share the stage for a collaborative evening of entertainment, including original folk, pop, and Americana, as well as traditional fiddle tunes and step dance.\n\n--\n\nLe Vent du Nord - Saturday, May 11 \n\n\n  \n      \n  \n    \n      Image    \n                    \n\n\n\n              \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\nLe Vent du Nord's vast repertoire draws from both traditional sources and original compositions, while enhancing its hard-driving soulful music (rooted in the Celtic diaspora) with a broad range of global influences. “Featuring button accordion, guitar and fiddle, the band’s sound is defined by the hurdy-gurdy, which adds an earthy, rough-hewn flavor to even the most buoyant dance tunes.” — Boston Herald\n"

But what happens when dancers age, and the physical demands of dance on the body begin to catch up to the dancer? In My Body welcomes this evolution, and its effects on street dancers.\n\n--\n\nCasting Off: A Good Catch - Sunday, October 15\n\n\n  \n      \n  \n    \n      Image    \n                    \n\n\n\n              \n\n  \n\n\n\nInspirational, intergenerational, and fantastically inappropriate: Casting Off is circus like you’ve never seen before.

The show’s collection of eclectic performers will have to choose between a football uniform or ballet outfit, symbolizing the boxes society so often forces people into: are you a tough, aggressive man, or a sweet and delicate woman?  \n\n--\n\nBenched: Uppercut Dance Theatre - Monday, May 27\n\n\n  \n      \n  \n    \n      Image    \n                    \n\n\n\n              \n\n  \n\n\n\nIn this contemporary Danish dance work, five male dancers perform in Johan Kølkjær’s set design of oversized and mobile benches that are constantly being transformed. The five dancers toss themselves around a long black bench, in a fusion of street and modern dance, as if it were a bouncy launch pad.  \n"

She holds ten Grammy awards and has been inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, and her influence on contemporary music is incalculable.\n\n\n  \n      \n  \n    \n      Image    \n                    \n\n\n\n              \n\n  \n\n\n \n\nNico Paulo - May 10 (Pay What You Will)\n\nNico Paulo is a Portuguese/Canadian pop songwriter, performer, and visual artist.

The group’s vast repertoire draws from both traditional sources and original compositions, while enhancing its hard-driving soulful music (rooted in the Celtic diaspora) with a broad range of global influences. “Featuring button accordion, guitar and fiddle, the band’s sound is defined by the hurdy-gurdy, which adds an earthy, rough-hewn flavor to even the most buoyant dance tunes.” — Boston Herald.\n\nFor the Rocker\n\n\n  \n      \n  \n    \n      Image    \n                    \n\n\n\n              \n\n  \n\n\n \n\nLes Hôtesses d’Hilaire - February 17 (Pay What You Will)\n\nLes Hôtesses d’Hilaire may have an offbeat sense of humour, but they’re always on beat when it comes to their lively tunes. This Acadian comedy-musical group, established in Moncton, NB in 2010, is known for their groovy, funky, psychedelic rock sound. Their lyrics are self-effacing and straight to the point: “I think it’s safe to say, we’re gonna have some fun today,” begins “Safe to Say”.

Unpredictable, whimsical, and adventurous, this performance is guaranteed fun for the whole family!\n\n \n\n\n  \n      \n  \n    \n      Image    \n                    \n\n\n\n              \n\n  \n\n\n \n\nThe Pack Drumline – February 3 \n\nGet ready for an electrifying performance with The Pack Drumline!

Well, the answer to that question might require some… acrobatics. Get ready to see it explored by powerful women, graceful men, and every permutation in between. Created by FLIP Fabrique, this is a circus show like you’ve never seen before - daring feats and amazing acrobatics are the canvas on which these performers play with gender roles and stereotypes.\n\nIf you’re not sure what show to pick, get them  a Playhouse gift certificate! When you purchase a gift certificate of $100, you will get a FREE Playhouse membership for the 2023-2024 season to keep for yourself or to gift! \n\nGive the gift of live performance this season.

        "@value": "Spotlight Series 24/25: Staff Top Picks\n\n \n\nThe Playhouse is buzzing with excitement about the 30 shows we're presenting through the 2024/25 Spotlight Series! Read on to see what our staff members had to say about their top picks coming up this season.\n\n \n\nTim Yerxa, Executive Director\n\n \n\n\n  \n      \n  \n    \n      Image    \n                    \n\n\n\n              \n\n  \n\n\n \n\n\"Of all the shows coming up next season, I’m really looking forward to the Peking Acrobats. The Spotlight Series has a great history with presenting circus shows, but they’re almost always contemporary circus. The Peking Acrobats are not quite contemporary, it’s kind of a throwback to more classic circus acts. Theres an incredible heritage and lineage in Chinese acrobatics and the Peking Acrobats have been perfecting their act for a long time. They predate Cirque du Soleil and a lot of the other companies you’ll see. \n\n On top of all that, it’s just a great show to bring a family to. We can’t have enough of those kinds of shows here; giving families an opportunity to do something together is more important now than it’s ever been.”\n\n \n\n\n\n Melissa Cameron, Ticketing Operations Manager\n\n \n\n\n  \n      \n  \n    \n      Image    \n                    \n\n\n\n              \n\n  \n\n\n \n\n\"The show I’m most excited for is definitely Lemon Bucket Orkestra. They were here a few years back and I was working in the box office at the time, so I got to listen to part of the show but I wasn’t actually in the theatre for it.\n\nPatrons came up to me for weeks after the show telling me how fantastic it was; how lively it was, how different of an experience it was from other shows they’ve caught here. And I missed it! So there’s no way I’m going to miss it again this year. They sounded like chaotic fun; very lively and energetic. The crowd absolutely went wild for them, I can’t wait to catch it live.”\n\n \n\nMeghan Callaghan, Ticketing Operations Manager\n\n \n\n\n  \n      \n  \n    \n      Image    \n                    \n\n\n\n              \n\n  \n\n\n \n\n\"The show that I think everybody has to see this season is As You Like It, or the Land Acknowledgement by Cliff Cardinal. I had no idea what the show was when it got booked and then I got sent a video of the full performance. We review all show footage in marketing and comms so we know how to talk about each of the shows. So I sat down and thought I’ll watch 15 minutes of this show just to get a taste for it’…I ended up watching the entire show in one sitting!\n\n It’s an incredible show. It’s Shakespeare like you’ve never seen it. The show is not at all what I was expecting it to be; it totally blew my mind. I didn’t know who Cliff Cardinal was but now I’m totally obsessed with his work. Everyone should see it, but go in with an open mind. Whatever you expect it to be, it’ll be totally different.”\n\n \n\nJeff Richardson, Director of Growth and Development\n\n \n\n\n  \n      \n  \n    \n      Image    \n                    \n\n\n\n              \n\n  \n\n\n \n\n\"I really can’t wait to see the Trans-Canada Highwaymen. I’ve been a huge fan of all of all of the respective bands for forever, in particular Sloan. Plus, Odds are hands-down one of the best rock bands ever.\n\nMy first ever concert was actually here at the Playhouse in 1993. It was a Barenaked Ladies concert, and my first real exposure to rock and roll. It’s fun all these years later to see Stephen Page coming back to perform on the same stage.\n\nIt’s going to be really unique and fun to see all these bands melded together, to see them play each other’s songs. For those of us who grew up in the 90’s listening to music, we know that each of these bands were staples of Canadian radio. We all had so many of their CDs. So it’s just so joyful and nostalgic to see them reliving their greatest hits like this.\"\n\n \n\nKatelyn Goodwin, Ticketing Supervisor\n\n \n\n\n  \n      \n  \n    \n      Image    \n                    \n\n\n\n              \n\n  \n\n\n \n\n\"The show I’m most excited for next year in the Spotlight Series is definitely Alan Cumming and Ari Shapiro in Och and Oy: A Considered Cabaret. The biggest reason is that I saw an interview with Alan where he said something like “…when you’re doing a play or musical you have to pretend the audience isn’t there. you’re in your own little world. But for a cabaret you have to make eye contact with the audience; you’re all in this together and sharing this experience.” I was already so excited when I heard that they were coming but that really sold me on the show.\n\nAlan has been in musicals and movies and TV shows that I’ve grown up with…my mom and I are obsessed with him. She was so over the moon when she found out he was performing here. It’s going to be an experience that we all share together!\"\n\n \n\nJason McIntyre, Marketing & Communications Coordinator \n\n \n\n\n  \n      \n  \n    \n      Image    \n                    \n\n\n\n              \n\n  \n\n\n \n\n\"My highlight of the upcoming Spotlight Series is definitely Snotty Nose Rez Kids. I've made playlists for all the music acts joining us next season, and as much as I like to listen to everybody we have coming up, more often than not I'm in the mood for upbeat rap. Once I dipped my toes in I was hooked. I may or may not have already reserved front row tickets for their show here.\n\nThe tracks are just so energized. You can tell they're throwing everything on their songs that they can, but having a lot of fun while doing it. Constant flow switch ups, pop culture references, tongue-in-cheek commentary. It's somehow very politically charged and socially conscious while also staying super playful and celebratory at the same time. They're kicking Canadian hip-hop up a notch, and doing it in style.\"\n\n \n\nWant to browse the full 24/25 Spotlight Series lineup yourself? Click here. \n"

        "@value": "As part of our InterMISSION Artist Residency program, the Playhouse is currently hosting artist in residence, Alyssa Martin, artistic director of the Toronto-based dance company Rock Bottom Movement. Alyssa founded Rock Bottom Movement in 2012 to further her creative endeavors in the world of dance and theatre, aiming to create tender dance pieces with an absurdist twist. Since then, Rock Bottom Movement has researched, created, and presented work throughout Canada (including favourites hollow mountain, DINO, Sex Dalmatian and KID SISTER). They have created in residence at numerous arts centres throughout the country including the Banff Centre for Creativity, Canadian Stage, and The Stratford Festival LAB. \n\nThe InterMISSION program was designed to provide artists a space to experiment and develop a given piece with the mentorship and support of our staff and facilities. We can’t wait to see how the Rock Bottom team makes use of their stay here. We will be hosting Alyssa and her team at the Playhouse from September 16th to September 21st as they develop an upcoming dance/theatre piece.  \n\nWhile in Fredericton working through her InterMISSION residency, Alyssa is leading a workshop in collaboration with Solo Chicken Productions, in partnership with the Playhouse and Black Box Productions. Creative Lozenge is a two-hour class that will leave students feeling creatively invigorated and ready to approach artistic projects with a greater sense of enthusiasm and playfulness. The workshop is designed to help you discover the tools you need to access your creative muscle when inspiration may be running low. \n\nCreative Lozenge takes place from 6:00-8:00 pm on Monday, September 16th at the Black Box Theatre on St. Thomas University campus. The workshop is offered through a Pay What You Wish payment option, with a suggested price of $25. \n\nRegister for Creative Lozenge here. \n\nAfter joining Alyssa for her workshop, be sure to check out the piece she’ll be perfecting over the course of her residency. Big Time Miss will be showcased on the Playhouse stage on September 21st, marking the culmination of months of hard work and development. The performance of this wildly creative and tongue-in-cheek show  is no deviation from the mission statement of Rock Bottom Movement: to create innovative dance pieces infused with punchy comedic beats. Revolving around themes of self-reckoning and battling fate, Big Time Miss follows dancers as they explore alternate realities and reflect on the choices they’ve made. \n\nMartin described her newest piece as, “…a modern-day tale that deliberates on imaginative coping mechanisms. I alleviate collective gloom by celebrating people's idiosyncrasies. I use laughter as a key to open the heart, to create a proverbial bouncy castle for audiences to cry in.” For her, humour is an essential coping mechanism to help people navigate through their lives. Hilarity, elation, grief, and doubt all keep each other company in Big Time Miss.  \n\nThe show takes place on Saturday, September 21st at 7:00pm and admission is completely free. Seating is general admission. The performance will be followed by a talk-back with the creative team behind the production. \n\nRead more about our staging of Big Time Miss here.   \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
