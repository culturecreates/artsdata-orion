The Poltava Dancers, directed by Lisa Wanner, is a male and female adult ensemble whose dancers have a high level of technical training in Ukrainian dance, ballet and folk dance. The Poltava Orchestra, under the direction of Cade Eastwood, brings to life the rich heritage of Ukrainian folk music, whether it accompanies the dancers or is featured as a performing entity unto itself.AppearancesDatePresented ByTicketsSun, Jan 26, 2025 @ 2:00 pmWatrous Area Arts CouncilTicket Info#\n    \n\n                                        \n                                        "

Like the river from which they draw their name, the trio crosses boundaries and borders, influencing and being influenced in return. The group had a promising start in Beirut, appearing at venues including the Syrian National Symphony Orchestra and the French Embassy before civil war intruded. Thanks to the Artist Protection Fund (APF) which helps musicians in areas of conflict, the group has found refuge in Canada. Hailing from different cultural and religious traditions themselves, the trio is keenly aware of how music transcends the barriers between us. They bring audiences an uplifting blend of baroque, flamenco and blues-inspired classical guitar, as they explore their new land and community in this Prairie Debut tour.AppearancesDatePresented ByTicketsFri, Jan 31, 2025 @ 7:30 pmRegina Musical ClubBuy Tickets#\n    \n\n                                        \n                                        "

You will be treated to an array of genres, like Celtic, Folk, Singer-Songwriter, Latin, Mexican, and Roots music sung in both English and Spanish to represent their respective Mexican and Chilean heritages. In addition, they will lean on folk musical idioms, such as Celtic, Roots, and Americana. Tom and Kalissa have a lovely vocal harmony blend and draw the listener in with great songs played on fiddle, guitar, and jarana (Mexican 8 string guitar). Perhaps one of the most endearing things about the couple is their relaxed and genuine stage banter, and the stories about the songs.
