Each websites loaded using the code in this repo created an artifact. All artifacts are in the group http://kg.artsdata.ca/databus/culture-creates/artsdata-orion

To create custom data pipelines or collaborate on an individual data source with others outside of Culture Creates, please create separate repos called artsdata-planet-[NAME].

- [page-url] URL of the webpage listing all events
